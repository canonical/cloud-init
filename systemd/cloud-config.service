[Service]
Type=oneshot
# This service is a shim which preserves systemd ordering while allowing a
# single Python process to run cloud-init's logic. This works by communicating
# with the cloud-init process over a unix socket to tell the process that this
# stage can start, and then wait on a return socket until the cloud-init
# process has completed this stage. The output from the return socket is piped
# into a shell so that the process can send a completion message (defaults to
# "done", otherwise includes an error message) and an exit code to systemd.
ExecStart=sh -c 'echo "start" | netcat -Uu -W1 /run/cloud-init/share/config.sock -s /run/cloud-init/share/config-return.sock | sh'
