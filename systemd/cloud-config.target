# cloud-config.target is the earliest synchronization point in cloud-init's
# boot stages that indicates the completion of datasource detection (cloud-id)
# and the presence of any meta-data, vendor-data and user-data.

# Any services started at cloud-config.target will need to be aware that
# cloud-init configuration modules have not yet completed initial system
# configuration of cloud-config modules and there may be race conditions with
# ongoing cloud-init setup, package installs or user-data scripts.

# Services that need to start at this point should use the directives
# "After=cloud-config.target" and "Wants=cloud-config.target" as appropriate.

# To order services after all cloud-init operations, see cloud-init.target.
