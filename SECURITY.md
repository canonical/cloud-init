# Security policy

The following documents the upstream cloud-init security policy.

## Reporting

If a security bug is found, please send an email to
<cloud-init-security@lists.canonical.com> . After the bug is received,
the issue is triaged within 2 working days of being reported and a response
is sent to the reporter.

## cloud-init-security

To report a security issue, file a [Private Security Report](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/security/advisories/new) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.
The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.

## Evaluation

If the reported bug is deemed a real security issue a CVE is assigned by
the Canonical Security Team as CVE Numbering Authority (CNA).

If it is deemed a regular, non-security issue, the reporter will be asked to
follow typical bug reporting procedures.

## Disclosure

Disclosure of security issues will be made with a public statement. Once the
determined time for disclosure has arrived the following will occur:

* A public bug is filed/made public with vulnerability details, CVE,
  mitigations and where to obtain the fix
* An announcement is made to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/discussions)
