# on.(pull_request|push).paths keys are not used because the steps in the jobs
# already handle filtering the file paths for specific globs.
# Also, we need the action to always be triggered (and succeed) if we decide to have this
# check to be blocking the PR. Otherwise (if on.(pull_request|push).paths are defined and the check is 
# blocking the PR), the PRs which do not have changes in these specific files will be blocked.
# Another minor reason for not using on.(pull_request|push).paths : it does not accept environment 
# variables so we would need to hardcode the yaml array to match env.GLOBS_TO_SHELLCHECK at the top of the file.

# Note: No need to specify the shell option in the shellcheck command.
# These linted scripts are for ubuntu so the !/bin/sh (i.e. system shell) shebang at the top of these scripts .
# So no need to pass the shell option to the shellcheck command as shellcheck will read the shebang at the top of the file (sh) so will
# use sh
