        This module runs arbitrary commands very early in the boot process,
        only slightly after a boothook would run. This is very similar to a
        boothook, but more user friendly. The environment variable
        ``INSTANCE_ID`` will be set to the current instance id for all run
        commands. Commands can be specified either as lists or strings. For
        invocation details, see ``runcmd``.

            bootcmd should only be used for things that could not be done later
            in the boot process.

        .. note::

          when writing files, do not use /tmp dir as it races with
          systemd-tmpfiles-clean LP: #1707222. Use /run/somedir instead.
