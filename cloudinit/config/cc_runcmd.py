# configuration options before actually attempting to deploy with said
# configuration.


MODULE_DESCRIPTION = """\
Run arbitrary commands at a rc.local like time-frame with output to the
console. Each item can be either a list or a string. The item type affects
how it is executed:


* If the item is a string, it will be interpreted by ``sh``.
* If the item is a list, the items will be executed as if passed to execve(3)
  (with the first arg as the command).

Note that the ``runcmd`` module only writes the script to be run
later. The module that actually runs the script is ``scripts-user``
in the :ref:`Final<boot-Final>` boot stage.

.. note::

    all commands must be proper yaml, so you have to quote any characters
    yaml would eat (':' can be problematic)

.. note::

    when writing files, do not use /tmp dir as it races with
    systemd-tmpfiles-clean LP: #1707222. Use /run/somedir instead.
