Reset RMC
------------
**Summary:** reset rsct node id

Reset RMC module is IBM PowerVM Hypervisor specific

Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT) is a set of software components,
that  together provide a comprehensive clustering environment (RAS features)
for IBM PowerVM based virtual machines. RSCT includes the Resource monitoring
and control (RMC) subsystem. RMC is a generalized framework used for managing,
monitoring, and manipulating resources. RMC runs as a daemon process on
individual machines and needs creation of unique node id and restarts
during VM boot.
More details refer
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SGVKBA_3.2/admin/bl503_ovrv.htm

This module handles
- creation of the unique RSCT node id to every instance/virtual machine
  and ensure once set, it isn't changed subsequently by cloud-init.
  In order to do so, it restarts RSCT service.

Prerequisite of using this module is to install RSCT packages.

**Internal name:** ``cc_reset_rmc``

**Module frequency:** per instance

**Supported distros:** rhel, sles and ubuntu
