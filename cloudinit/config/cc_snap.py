        This module provides a simple configuration namespace in cloud-init to
        both setup snapd and install snaps.

        .. note::
            Both ``assertions`` and ``commands`` values can be either a
            dictionary or a list. If these configs are provided as a
            dictionary, the keys are only used to order the execution of the
            assertions or commands and the dictionary is merged with any
            vendor-data snap configuration provided. If a list is provided by
            the user instead of a dict, any vendor-data snap configuration is
            ignored.

        The ``assertions`` configuration option is a dictionary or list of
        properly-signed snap assertions which will run before any snap
        ``commands``. They will be added to snapd's assertion database by
        invoking ``snap ack <aggregate_assertion_file>``.

        Snap ``commands`` is a dictionary or list of individual snap
        commands to run on the target system. These commands can be used to
        create snap users, install snaps and provide snap configuration.

        .. note::
            If 'side-loading' private/unpublished snaps on an instance, it is
            best to create a snap seed directory and seed.yaml manifest in
            **/var/lib/snapd/seed/** which snapd automatically installs on
            startup.
