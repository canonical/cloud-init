Scripts User
------------
**Summary:** run user scripts

This module runs all user scripts. User scripts are not specified in the
``scripts`` directory in the datasource, but rather are present in the
``scripts`` dir in the instance configuration. Any cloud-config parts with a
``#!`` will be treated as a script and run. Scripts specified as cloud-config
parts will be run in the order they are specified in the configuration.
This module does not accept any config keys.

**Internal name:** ``cc_scripts_user``

**Module frequency:** per instance

**Supported distros:** all
