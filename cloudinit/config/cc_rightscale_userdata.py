Rightscale Userdata
-------------------
**Summary:** support rightscale configuration hooks

This module adds support for RightScale configuration hooks to cloud-init.
RightScale adds a entry in the format ``CLOUD_INIT_REMOTE_HOOK=http://...`` to
ec2 user-data. This module checks for this line in the raw userdata and
retrieves any scripts linked by the RightScale user data and places them in the
user scripts configuration directory, to be run later by ``cc_scripts_user``.

.. note::
    the ``CLOUD_INIT_REMOTE_HOOK`` config variable is present in the raw ec2
    user data only, not in any cloud-config parts

**Internal name:** ``cc_rightscale_userdata``

**Module frequency:** per instance

**Supported distros:** all

**Config keys**::

    CLOUD_INIT_REMOTE_HOOK=<url>
"""

#
# The purpose of this script is to allow cloud-init to consume
# rightscale style userdata.  rightscale user data is key-value pairs
# in a url-query-string like format.
#
# for cloud-init support, there will be a key named
# 'CLOUD_INIT_REMOTE_HOOK'.
#
# This cloud-config module will
# - read the blob of data from raw user data, and parse it as key/value
# - for each key that is found, download the content to
#   the local instance/scripts directory and set them executable.
# - the files in that directory will be run by the user-scripts module
#   Therefore, this must run before that.
