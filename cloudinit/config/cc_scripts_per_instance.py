Scripts Per Instance
--------------------
**Summary:** run per instance scripts

Any scripts in the ``scripts/per-instance`` directory on the datasource will
be run when a new instance is first booted. Scripts will be run in alphabetical
order. This module does not accept any config keys.

Some cloud platforms change instance-id if a significant change was made to
the system. As a result per-instance scripts will run again.

**Internal name:** ``cc_scripts_per_instance``

**Module frequency:** per instance

**Supported distros:** all
