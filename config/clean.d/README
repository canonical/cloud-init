-- cloud-init's clean.d run-parts directory --

This directory is provided for third party applications which need
additional configuration artifact cleanup from the filesystem when
the command `cloud-init clean` is invoked.

The `cloud-init clean` operation is typically performed by image creators
when preparing a golden image for clone and redeployment. The clean command
removes any cloud-init semaphores, allowing cloud-init to treat the next
boot of this image as the "first boot". When the image is next booted
cloud-init will performing all initial configuration based on any valid
datasource meta-data and user-data.

Any executable scripts in this subdirectory will be invoked in lexicographical
order with run-parts by the command: sudo cloud-init clean.

Typical format of such scripts would be a ##-<some-app> like the following:
  /etc/cloud/clean.d/99-live-installer
