How do I get help?
==================

Having trouble? We would like to help!

- First go through this page with answers to common questions
- Use the search bar at the upper left to search our documentation
- Ask questions in the ``#cloud-init`` `IRC channel on Libera`_
- Join and ask questions on the ``cloud-init`` `mailing list`_
- Find a bug? Check out the :ref:`reporting_bugs` topic to find out how to
  report one

Why did ``cloud-init`` never complete?
======================================

To check if ``cloud-init`` is running still, run:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   cloud-init status

To wait for ``cloud-init`` to complete, run:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   cloud-init status --wait

There are a number of reasons that ``cloud-init`` might never complete. This
list is not exhaustive, but attempts to enumerate potential causes:

External reasons
----------------

- Failed dependent services in the boot.
- Bugs in the kernel or drivers.
- Bugs in external userspace tools that are called by ``cloud-init``.

Internal reasons
----------------

- A command in ``bootcmd`` or ``runcmd`` that never completes (e.g., running
  :command:`cloud-init status --wait` will wait forever on itself and never
  complete).
- Non-standard configurations that disable timeouts or set extremely high
  values ("never" is used in a loose sense here).

Failing to complete on ``systemd``
----------------------------------

``Cloud-init`` consists of multiple services on ``systemd``. If a service
that ``cloud-init`` depends on stalls, ``cloud-init`` will not continue.
If reporting a bug related to ``cloud-init`` failing to complete on
``systemd``, please make sure to include the following logs.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   systemd-analyze critical-chain cloud-init.target
   journalctl --boot=-1
   systemctl --failed

``autoinstall``, ``preruncmd``, ``postruncmd``
==============================================

Since ``cloud-init`` ignores top level user data ``cloud-config`` keys, other
projects such as `Juju`_ and `Subiquity autoinstaller`_ use a YAML-formatted
config that combines ``cloud-init``'s user data cloud-config YAML format with
their custom YAML keys. Since ``cloud-init`` ignores unused top level keys,
these combined YAML configurations may be valid ``cloud-config`` files,
however keys such as ``autoinstall``, ``preruncmd``, and ``postruncmd`` are
not used by ``cloud-init`` to configure anything.

Please direct bugs and questions about other projects that use ``cloud-init``
to their respective support channels. For Subiquity autoinstaller that is via
IRC (``#ubuntu-server`` on Libera) or Discourse. For Juju support see their
`discourse page`_.

Can I use cloud-init as a library?
==================================
Please don't. Some projects `do`_. However, ``cloud-init`` does not
currently make any API guarantees to either external consumers or out-of-tree
datasources / modules. Current users of cloud-init as a library are
projects that have close contact with ``cloud-init``, which is why this
(fragile) model currently works.

For those that choose to ignore this advice, logging in cloud-init is
configured in ``cloud-init/cmd/main.py``, and reconfigured in the
``cc_rsyslog`` module for obvious reasons.
