Network configuration
*********************

Default behaviour
=================

``Cloud-init`` searches for network configuration in order of increasing
precedence; each item overriding the previous.

- **Datasource**: For example, OpenStack may provide network config in the
  MetaData Service.
- **System config**: A ``network:`` entry in :file:`/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/*`
  configuration files.
- **Kernel command line**: ``ip=`` or
  ``network-config=<Base64 encoded YAML config string>``

User data cannot change an instance's network configuration. In the absence
of network configuration in any of the above sources, ``cloud-init`` will
write out a network configuration that will issue a DHCP request on a "first"
network interface.

.. note::

   The ``network-config`` value is expected to be a Base64 encoded YAML string
   in :ref:`network_config_v1` or :ref:`network_config_v2` format. Optionally,
   it can be compressed with ``gzip`` prior to Base64 encoding.

Disabling network configuration
===============================

Users may disable ``cloud-init``'s network configuration capability and rely
on other methods, such as embedded configuration or other customisations.

``cloud-init`` supports the following methods for disabling ``cloud-init``.

Kernel command line
-------------------

``Cloud-init`` will check for the parameter ``network-config=disabled``,
which will automatically disable any network configuration.

Example disabling kernel command line entry: ::

  network-config=disabled

Cloud config
------------

In the combined ``cloud-init`` configuration dictionary, merged from
:file:`/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` and :file:`/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/*`: ::

  network:
    config: disabled

If ``cloud-init``'s networking config has not been disabled, and no other
network information is found, then it will proceed to generate a fallback
networking configuration.

Disabling network activation
============================

Some datasources may not be initialised until after the network has been
brought up. In this case, ``cloud-init`` will attempt to bring up the
interfaces specified by the datasource metadata using a network activator
discovered by `cloudinit.net.activators.select_activator`_.

This behaviour can be disabled in the ``cloud-init`` configuration dictionary,
merged from :file:`/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` and
:file:`/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/*`: ::

  disable_network_activation: true

Fallback network configuration
==============================

``Cloud-init`` will attempt to determine which, of any attached network
devices, is most likely to have a connection and then generate a network
configuration to issue a DHCP request on that interface.

``Cloud-init`` runs during early boot and does not expect composed network
devices (such as Bridges) to be available. ``Cloud-init`` does not consider
the following interface devices as likely "first" network interfaces for
fallback configuration; they are filtered out from being selected.

- **loopback**: ``name=lo``
- **Virtual Ethernet**: ``name=veth*``
- **Software Bridges**: ``type=bridge``
- **Software VLANs**: ``type=vlan``

``Cloud-init`` will prefer network interfaces that indicate they are connected
via the Linux ``carrier`` flag being set. If no interfaces are marked as
connected, then all unfiltered interfaces are potential connections.

Of the potential interfaces, ``cloud-init`` will attempt to pick the "right"
interface given the information it has available.

Finally, after selecting the "right" interface, a configuration is generated
and applied to the system.

.. note::
   PhotonOS disables fallback networking configuration by default, leaving
   network unrendered when no other network config is provided.
   If fallback config is still desired on PhotonOS, it can be enabled by
   providing ``disable_fallback_netcfg: false`` in
   :file:`/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg:sys_config` settings.

Network configuration sources
=============================

``Cloud-init`` accepts a number of different network configuration formats in
support of different cloud substrates. The datasource for these clouds in
``cloud-init`` will detect and consume datasource-specific network
configuration formats for use when writing an instance's network
configuration.

The following datasources optionally provide network configuration:

- :ref:`datasource_config_drive`

  - `OpenStack Metadata Service Network`_
  - :ref:`network_config_eni`

- :ref:`datasource_digital_ocean`

  - `DigitalOcean JSON metadata`_

- :ref:`datasource_lxd`

  - `LXD`_

- :ref:`datasource_nocloud`

  - :ref:`network_config_v1`
  - :ref:`network_config_v2`
  - :ref:`network_config_eni`

- :ref:`datasource_opennebula`

  - :ref:`network_config_eni`

- :ref:`datasource_openstack`

  - :ref:`network_config_eni`
  - `OpenStack Metadata Service Network`_

- :ref:`datasource_smartos`

  - `SmartOS JSON Metadata`_

- :ref:`datasource_upcloud`

  - `UpCloud JSON metadata`_

- :ref:`datasource_vultr`

  - `Vultr JSON metadata`_

Network configuration outputs
=============================

``Cloud-init`` converts various forms of user-supplied or automatically
generated configuration into an internal network configuration state. From
this state, ``cloud-init`` delegates rendering of the configuration to
distro-supported formats. The following ``renderers`` are supported in
``cloud-init``:

NetworkManager
--------------

`NetworkManager`_ is the standard Linux network configuration tool suite. It
supports a wide range of networking setups. Configuration is typically stored
in :file:`/etc/NetworkManager`.

It is the default for a number of Linux distributions; notably Fedora,
CentOS/RHEL, and their derivatives.

ENI
---

:file:`/etc/network/interfaces` or ``ENI`` is supported by the ``ifupdown``
package found in Alpine Linux, Debian and Ubuntu.

Netplan
-------

Introduced in Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak), `Netplan`_ has been the default
network configuration tool in Ubuntu since 17.10 (Artful Aardvark). Netplan
consumes :ref:`network_config_v2` input and renders network configuration for
supported backends such as ``systemd-networkd`` and ``NetworkManager``.

Sysconfig
---------

Sysconfig format is used by RHEL, CentOS, Fedora and other derivatives.

NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD
------------------------

Network renders supporting BSD releases, which typically write configuration
to :file:`/etc/rc.conf`. Unique to BSD renderers is that each renderer also
calls something akin to `FreeBSD.start_services`_ which will invoke applicable
network services to setup the network, making network activators unneeded
for BSD flavors at the moment.

Network output policy
=====================

The default policy for selecting a network ``renderer`` (in order of
preference) is as follows:

- ENI
- Sysconfig
- Netplan
- NetworkManager
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD
- Networkd

The default policy for selecting a network ``activator`` (in order of
preference) is as follows:

- **ENI**: using ``ifup``, ``ifdown`` to manage device setup/teardown
- **Netplan**: using ``netplan apply`` to manage device setup/teardown
- **NetworkManager**: using ``nmcli`` to manage device setup/teardown
- **Networkd**: using ``ip`` to manage device setup/teardown

When applying the policy, ``cloud-init`` checks if the current instance has the
correct binaries and paths to support the renderer. The first renderer that
can be used is selected. Users may override the network renderer policy by
supplying an updated configuration in cloud-config. ::

  system_info:
    network:
      renderers: ['netplan', 'network-manager', 'eni', 'sysconfig', 'freebsd', 'netbsd', 'openbsd']
      activators: ['eni', 'netplan', 'network-manager', 'networkd']

Network configuration tools
===========================

``Cloud-init`` contains a command used to test input/output conversion between
formats. The :file:`tools/net-convert.py` in the ``cloud-init`` source
repository is helpful in examining expected output for a given input
format. If running these commands from the cloud-init source directory,
make sure to set the correct path ``PYTHON_PATH=.``

CLI Interface:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ cloud-init devel net-convert --help

Example output:

.. code-block::
