How to contribute to cloud-init
*******************************

Thank you for wanting to help us improve cloud-init! There are a variety of
ways you can contribute to this project, including no-code and low-code
options. This documentation will help orient you with our processes.

Please make sure that you read all of the pages in this guide before starting
to contribute. It contains everything that you need to give your contribution
the best chance of being accepted.

Cloud-init is hosted and managed on `GitHub`_. If you're not
familiar with how GitHub works, their
`quickstart documentation`_
provides an excellent introduction to all the tools and processes you'll need
to know.
