Find issues to work on
**********************

Bugs and issues are tracked on `on GitHub`_.

For new contributors, we especially recommend finding issues labeled
**good first issue**, and during Hacktoberfest the **hacktoberfest** label
should contain self-contained issues suitable for participants.

If you would like to work on documentation specifically, you can also use the
**documentation** label to filter the list of issues.

Claim an issue
==============

You can express your interest in an issue by posting a comment on it. If a week
has passed without a status update or PR created, other contributors may
consider the issue to be available for them to work on.

No-code or low-code options
===========================

Contributing to our documentation is a great way to get involved with no or
minimal coding experience.

If you can't find a documentation issue you want to work on, you can always
`read the documentation <the docs_>`_ and see what improvements you think can
be made. Common documentation issues include:

* spelling and grammar
* the user interface/experience (UI/UX)
* accessibility
* the CSS theming
* or even just highlighting things you found confusing or unclear
