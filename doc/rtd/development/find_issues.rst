Find issues to work on
**********************

We track bugs and issues with GitHub issues, and use labels to categorise them.
You can filter the list of open issues by different labels according to what
you're interested in contributing.

For new contributors, we especially recommend using the "good first issue"
label, and during Hacktoberfest we also add the "hacktoberfest" label to
smaller, self-contained issues suitable for participants.

If you would like to work on documentation specifically, you can also use the
"documentation" label to filter the list of issues.

Claiming an issue
=================

You can express your interest in an issue by posting a comment on it. You
should only work on one open issue at a time to avoid overloading yourself.

If you have not submitted a PR or commented with an updated status within a
week of leaving your initial comment, other contributors should consider the
issue to be available for them to work on.

When you submit your proposed fix for an issue, including the issue number in
the PR commit message will link the issue to your proposed fix. This is the
``Fixes GH-0000`` line in the template PR commit message.

Creating an issue
=================

If you've spotted something that doesn't already have an issue, you can always
create one in GitHub.

For documentation issues, you can submit an issue in GitHub using the
"Give feedback" button at the top of each documentation page. It will
automatically include the URL of the page you came from, so all you need to
do is describe the issue you've found.

No-code or low-code options
===========================

Contributing to our documentation is a great way to get involved with no or
minimal coding experience.

If you can't find a documentation issue you want to work on, you can always
`check out the documentation <the docs_>`_ for yourself and see what
improvements you think can be made. This might be related to:

* spelling and grammar
* the user interface/experience (UI/UX)
* accessibility
* the CSS theming
* or even just highlighting things you found confusing or unclear

Feel free to `contact us on IRC <IRC_>`_ if you have other ideas about
contributions you might want to make, such as blog posts, guides, or tutorials.
