The cloud-init summit
*********************

One of the major highlights in our calendar is the cloud-init summit! The
summit is an annual gathering of cloud-init contributors and community members
held in Seattle, Washington.

At the summit, we enjoy meeting with our fellow contributors to cloud-init,
demoing recent developments, collecting feedback, and holding workshops to
discuss outstanding issues, bugs, and possible fixes.

After an unfortunate hiatus of a couple of years due to "global travel
difficulties", we are pleased to announced that the next summit will be held in
August 2023! More details to follow...
