Last week the cloud-init development team from Canonical ran a two-day summit
in Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the summit was to meet with contributors
to cloud-init from cloud providers and OS vendors to demo recent developments
in cloud-init, resolve outstanding issues, and collect feedback on development
and test processes as well as future features.

Attendees included developers from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, VMWare, and IBM
cloud teams, as well as the maintainers of cloud-init from Red Hat, SUSE, and
of course, Ubuntu. Special thanks go to Google for hosting us and to Microsoft
for buying everyone dinner!

Demos
=====

The cloud-init development team came with a number of prepared demos and talks
that they gave as a part of the summit:

* **cloud-init analyze**: Ryan demoed the recently added analyze feature to aid
  in doing boot time performance analysis. This tool parses the cloud-init log
  into formatted and sorted events to assist in determining long running steps
  during instance initialization.
* **cloud-config Schema Validation**: Chad demonstrated the early functionality
  to validate cloud-configs before launching instances. He demoed two modules
  that exist today, how to write the validation, and what positive and negative
  results look like.
* **Integration Testing and CI**: Josh demonstrated the integration test
  framework and shared plans on running tests on actual clouds. Then showed the
  merge request CI process and encouraged this as a way for other OSes to
  participate.
* **Using lxd for Rapid Development and Testing**: Scott demoed setting
  userdata when launching a lxd instance and how this can be used in the
  development process. He also discussed lxd image remotes and types of images.

Breakout Sessions
=================

In addition to the prepared demos, the summit had numerous sessions that were
requested by the attendees as additional topics for discussion:

* Netplan (v2 YAML) as primary format
* How to query metadata
* Version numbering
* Device hot-plug
* Python 3
* And moreâ€¦

During the summit, we took time to have merge review and bug squashing time.
During this time, attendees came with outstanding bugs to discuss possible
fixes as well as go through outstanding merge requests and get live reviews.

A big thanks to the community for attending! The summit was a great time to
meet many long time users and contributors face-to-face as well as collect
feedback for cloud-init development.
