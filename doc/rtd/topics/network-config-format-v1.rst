.. _network_config_v1:

Networking Config Version 1
===========================

This network configuration format lets users customize their instance's
networking interfaces by assigning subnet configuration, virtual device
creation (bonds, bridges, vlans) routes and DNS configuration.

Required elements of a Network Config Version 1 are ``config`` and
``version``.

Cloud-init will read this format from system config.
For example the following could be present in
``/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/custom-networking.cfg``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  network:
    version: 1
    config:
    - type: physical
      name: eth0
      subnets:
        - type: dhcp

The :ref:`datasource_nocloud` datasource can also provide cloud-init
networking configuration in this Format.

Configuration Types
-------------------
Within the network ``config`` portion, users include a list of configuration
types.  The current list of support ``type`` values are as follows:

- Physical (``physical``)
- Bond (``bond``)
- Bridge (``bridge``)
- VLAN (``vlan``)
- Nameserver (``nameserver``)
- Route (``route``)

Physical, Bond, Bridge and VLAN types may also include IP configuration under
the key ``subnets``.

- Subnet/IP (``subnets``)


Physical
~~~~~~~~
The ``physical`` type configuration represents a "physical" network device,
typically Ethernet-based.  At least one of these entries is required for
external network connectivity.  Type ``physical`` requires only one key:
``name``.  A ``physical`` device may contain some or all of the following
keys:

**name**: *<desired device name>*

A devices name must be less than 15 characters.  Names exceeding the maximum
will be truncated. This is a limitation of the Linux kernel network-device
structure.

**mac_address**: *<MAC Address>*

The MAC Address is a device unique identifier that most Ethernet-based network
devices possess. Specifying a MAC Address is optional.
Letters must be lowercase.

.. note::

  MAC addresses must be strings. As MAC addresses which consist of only the
  digits 0-9 (i.e. no hex a-f) can be interpreted as a base 60 integer per
  the `YAML 1.1 spec`_ it is best practice to quote all MAC addresses to ensure
  they are parsed as strings regardless of value.

.. _YAML 1.1 spec: https://yaml.org/type/int.html

.. note::

  Cloud-init will handle the persistent mapping between a
  device's ``name`` and the ``mac_address``.

**mtu**: *<MTU SizeBytes>*

The MTU key represents a device's Maximum Transmission Unit, the largest size
packet or frame, specified in octets (eight-bit bytes), that can be sent in a
packet- or frame-based network.  Specifying ``mtu`` is optional.

.. note::

  The possible supported values of a device's MTU is not available at
  configuration time.  It's possible to specify a value too large or to
  small for a device and may be ignored by the device.


**Physical Example**::

  network:
    version: 1
    config:
      # Simple network adapter
      - type: physical
        name: interface0
        mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
      # Second nic with Jumbo frames
      - type: physical
        name: jumbo0
        mac_address: aa:11:22:33:44:55
        mtu: 9000
      # 10G pair
      - type: physical
        name: gbe0
        mac_address: cd:11:22:33:44:00
      - type: physical
        name: gbe1
        mac_address: cd:11:22:33:44:02

Bond
~~~~
A ``bond`` type will configure a Linux software Bond with one or more network
devices.  A ``bond`` type requires the following keys:

**name**: *<desired device name>*

A devices name must be less than 15 characters.  Names exceeding the maximum
will be truncated. This is a limitation of the Linux kernel network-device
structure.

**mac_address**: *<MAC Address>*

When specifying MAC Address on a bond this value will be assigned to the bond
device and may be different than the MAC address of any of the underlying
bond interfaces.  Specifying a MAC Address is optional.  If ``mac_address`` is
not present, then the bond will use one of the MAC Address values from one of
the bond interfaces.

.. note::

  MAC addresses must be strings. As MAC addresses which consist of only the
  digits 0-9 (i.e. no hex a-f) can be interpreted as a base 60 integer per
  the `YAML 1.1 spec`_ it is best practice to quote all MAC addresses to ensure
  they are parsed as strings regardless of value.

.. _YAML 1.1 spec: https://yaml.org/type/int.html

**bond_interfaces**: *<List of network device names>*

The ``bond_interfaces`` key accepts a list of network device ``name`` values
from the configuration.  This list may be empty.

**mtu**: *<MTU SizeBytes>*

The MTU key represents a device's Maximum Transmission Unit, the largest size
packet or frame, specified in octets (eight-bit bytes), that can be sent in a
packet- or frame-based network.  Specifying ``mtu`` is optional.

.. note::

  The possible supported values of a device's MTU is not available at
  configuration time.  It's possible to specify a value too large or to
  small for a device and may be ignored by the device.

**params**:  *<Dictionary of key: value bonding parameter pairs>*

The ``params`` key in a bond holds a dictionary of bonding parameters.
This dictionary may be empty. For more details on what the various bonding
parameters mean please read the Linux Kernel Bonding.txt.

         vlan_link: eth0
         vlan_id: 101
         mtu: 1500

Nameserver
~~~~~~~~~~

Users can specify a ``nameserver`` type.  Nameserver dictionaries include
the following keys:

- ``address``: List of IPv4 or IPv6 address of nameservers.
- ``search``: List of hostnames to include in the resolv.conf search path.
- ``interface``: Optional. Ties the nameserver definition to the specified
  interface. The value specified here must match the `name` of an interface
  defined in this config. If unspecified, this nameserver will be considered
  a global nameserver.

**Nameserver Example**::

  network:
    version: 1
    config:
      - type: physical
        name: interface0
        mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
        subnets:
           - type: static
             address: 192.168.23.14/27
             gateway: 192.168.23.1
      - type: nameserver
        interface: interface0  # Ties nameserver to interface0 only
        address:
          - 192.168.23.2
          - 8.8.8.8
        search:
          - exemplary



Route
~~~~~

Users can include static routing information as well.  A ``route`` dictionary
has the following keys:

- ``destination``: IPv4 network address with CIDR netmask notation.
- ``gateway``: IPv4 gateway address with CIDR netmask notation.
- ``metric``: Integer which sets the network metric value for this route.

**Route Example**::

  network:
    version: 1
    config:
      - type: physical
        name: interface0
        mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
        subnets:
           - type: static
             address: 192.168.23.14/24
             gateway: 192.168.23.1
      - type: route
        destination: 192.168.24.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.24.1
        metric: 3

Subnet/IP
~~~~~~~~~

For any network device (one of the Config Types) users can define a list of
``subnets`` which contain ip configuration dictionaries.  Multiple subnet
entries will create interface alias allowing a single interface to use
different ip configurations.

Valid keys for ``subnets`` include the following:

- ``type``: Specify the subnet type.
- ``control``: Specify manual, auto or hotplug.  Indicates how the interface
  will be handled during boot.
- ``address``: IPv4 or IPv6 address.  It may include CIDR netmask notation.
- ``netmask``: IPv4 subnet mask in dotted format or CIDR notation.
- ``gateway``: IPv4 address of the default gateway for this subnet.
- ``dns_nameservers``: Specify a list of IPv4 dns server IPs to end up in
  resolv.conf.
- ``dns_search``: Specify a list of search paths to be included in
  resolv.conf.
- ``routes``:  Specify a list of routes for a given interface


Subnet types are one of the following:

- ``dhcp4``: Configure this interface with IPv4 dhcp.
- ``dhcp``: Alias for ``dhcp4``
- ``dhcp6``: Configure this interface with IPv6 dhcp.
- ``static``: Configure this interface with a static IPv4.
- ``static6``: Configure this interface with a static IPv6 .
- ``ipv6_dhcpv6-stateful``: Configure this interface with ``dhcp6``
- ``ipv6_dhcpv6-stateless``: Configure this interface with SLAAC and DHCP
- ``ipv6_slaac``: Configure address with SLAAC

When making use of ``dhcp`` or either of the ``ipv6_dhcpv6`` types,
no additional configuration is needed in the subnet dictionary.

Using ``ipv6_dhcpv6-stateless`` or ``ipv6_slaac`` allows the IPv6 address to be
automatically configured with StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (`SLAAC`_).
SLAAC requires support from the network, so verify that your cloud or network
offering has support before trying it out. With ``ipv6_dhcpv6-stateless``,
DHCPv6 is still used to fetch other subnet details such as gateway or DNS
servers. If you only want to discover the address, use ``ipv6_slaac``.


**Subnet DHCP Example**::

   network:
     version: 1
     config:
       - type: physical
         name: interface0
         mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
         subnets:
           - type: dhcp


**Subnet Static Example**::

   network:
     version: 1
     config:
       - type: physical
         name: interface0
         mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
         subnets:
           - type: static
             address: 192.168.23.14/27
             gateway: 192.168.23.1
             dns_nameservers:
               - 192.168.23.2
               - 8.8.8.8
             dns_search:
               - exemplary.maas

The following will result in an ``interface0`` using DHCP and ``interface0:1``
using the static subnet configuration.

**Multiple subnet Example**::

   network:
     version: 1
     config:
       - type: physical
         name: interface0
         mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
         subnets:
           - type: dhcp
           - type: static
             address: 192.168.23.14/27
             gateway: 192.168.23.1
             dns_nameservers:
               - 192.168.23.2
               - 8.8.8.8
             dns_search:
               - exemplary

**Subnet with routes Example**::

   network:
     version: 1
     config:
       - type: physical
         name: interface0
         mac_address: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
         subnets:
           - type: dhcp
           - type: static
             address: 10.184.225.122
             netmask: 255.255.255.252
             routes:
               - gateway: 10.184.225.121
                 netmask: 255.240.0.0
                 network: 10.176.0.0
               - gateway: 10.184.225.121
                 netmask: 255.240.0.0
                 network: 10.208.0.0


Multi-layered configurations
----------------------------

Complex networking sometimes uses layers of configuration.  The syntax allows
users to build those layers one at a time.  All of the virtual network devices
supported allow specifying an underlying device by their ``name`` value.

**Bonded VLAN Example**::

  network:
    version: 1
    config:
      # 10G pair
      - type: physical
        name: gbe0
        mac_address: cd:11:22:33:44:00
      - type: physical
        name: gbe1
        mac_address: cd:11:22:33:44:02
      # Bond.
      - type: bond
        name: bond0
        bond_interfaces:
          - gbe0
          - gbe1
        params:
          bond-mode: 802.3ad
          bond-lacp-rate: fast
      # A Bond VLAN.
      - type: vlan
          name: bond0.200
          vlan_link: bond0
          vlan_id: 200
          subnets:
              - type: dhcp4
