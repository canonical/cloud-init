This section contains step-by-step tutorials to help you learn about
cloud-init.

New user tutorial
=================

If you are completely new to cloud-init and would like a more thorough
introduction, we suggest starting with the
:ref:`new user tutorial <tutorial_qemu>`.

This tutorial uses the QEMU emulator to introduce you to all of the key
concepts, tools, processes and operations that you will need to use cloud-init
successfully.

Further tutorials
=================

This section is recommended if you have some familiarity with cloud-init's key
concepts already. It uses LXD containers to show more of cloud-init's
capabilities.

* :ref:`Part 1: quick deployment <tutorial_lxd>`

  This section deploys a cloud-init user data script into a LXD container. It
  can also be used as a quick-start guide.
