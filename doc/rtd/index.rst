cloud-init Documentation
########################

Cloud-init is the *industry standard* multi-distribution method for
cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major
public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure,
and bare-metal installations.

During boot, cloud-init identifies the cloud it is running on and initializes
the system accordingly. Cloud instances will automatically be provisioned
during first boot with networking, storage, SSH keys, packages and various
other system aspects already configured.

Cloud-init provides the necessary glue between launching a cloud instance and
connecting to it so that it works as expected.

For cloud users, cloud-init provides no-install first-boot configuration
management of a cloud instance. For cloud providers, it provides instance setup
that can be integrated with your cloud.
