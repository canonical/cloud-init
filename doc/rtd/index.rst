cloud-init Documentation
########################

Cloud-init is the *industry standard* multi-distribution method for
cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all
major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud
infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

On instance boot, cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on, read
any provided metadata from the cloud, and initialize the system accordingly.
This may involve setting up the network and storage devices, configuring SSH
access keys, and setting up many other aspects of a system. Later,
cloud-init will parse and process any optional user or vendor data that was
passed to the instance.
