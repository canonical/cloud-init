#
# This is an example file to configure an instance's trusted CA certificates
# system-wide for SSL/TLS trust establishment when the instance boots for the
# first time.
#
# Make sure that this file is valid yaml before starting instances.
# It should be passed as user-data when starting the instance.

ca_certs:
  # If present and set to True, the 'remove_defaults' parameter will either
  # disable all the trusted CA certifications normally shipped with
  # Alpine, Debian or Ubuntu. On RedHat, this action will delete those
  # certificates.
  # This is mainly for very security-sensitive use cases - most users will not
  # need this functionality.
  remove_defaults: true

  # If present, the 'trusted' parameter should contain a certificate (or list
  # of certificates) to add to the system as trusted CA certificates.
  # Pay close attention to the YAML multiline list syntax.  The example shown
  # here is for a list of multiline certificates.
