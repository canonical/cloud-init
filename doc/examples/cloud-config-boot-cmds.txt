#cloud-config

# boot commands
# default: none
# This is very similar to runcmd, but commands run very early
# in the boot process, only slightly after a 'boothook' would run.
# - bootcmd will run on every boot
# - INSTANCE_ID variable will be set to the current instance ID
# - 'cloud-init-per' command can be used to make bootcmd run exactly once
bootcmd:
  - echo 192.168.1.130 us.archive.ubuntu.com >> /etc/hosts
  - [ cloud-init-per, once, mymkfs, mkfs, /dev/vdb ]
