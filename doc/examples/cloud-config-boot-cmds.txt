#cloud-config

# boot commands
# default: none
# this is very similar to runcmd, but commands run very early
# in the boot process, only slightly after a 'boothook' would run.
# bootcmd should really only be used for things that could not be
# done later in the boot process.  bootcmd is very much like
# boothook, but possibly with more friendly.
#  * bootcmd will run on every boot
#  * the INSTANCE_ID variable will be set to the current instance id.
#  * you can use 'cloud-init-boot-per' command to help only run once
bootcmd:
 - echo 192.168.1.130 us.archive.ubuntu.com > /etc/hosts
 - [ cloud-init-per, once, mymkfs, mkfs, /dev/vdb ]
