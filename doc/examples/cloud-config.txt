## hostname and /etc/hosts management
# cloud-init can handle updating some entries in /etc/hosts,
# and can set your hostname for you.
#
# if you do nothing you'll end up with:
#  * /etc/hostname (and `hostname`) managed via: 'preserve_hostame: false'
#    if you do not change /etc/hostname, it will be updated with the cloud
#    provided hostname on each boot.  If you make a change, then manual
#    maintenance takes over, and cloud-init will not modify it.
#
#  * /etc/hosts managed via: 'manage_etc_hosts: false'
#    cloud-init will not manage /etc/hosts at all.  It is in full manual
#    maintenance mode.
#
# You can change the above behavior with the following config variables:
#  Remember that these can be set in cloud-config via user-data,
#  /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or any file in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/
#
# == Hostname management (via /etc/hostname) ==
#  * preserve_hostname:
#      default: False
#      If this option is set to True, then /etc/hostname will never updated
#      The default behavior is to update it if it has not been modified by
#      the user.
#
#  * hostname:
#      this option will be used wherever the 'hostname' is needed
#      simply substitute it in the description above.
#      ** If you wish to set your hostname, set it here **
#      default: 'hostname' as returned by the metadata service
#               on EC2, the hostname portion of 'local-hostname' is used
#               which is something like 'ip-10-244-170-199'
#
#  * fqdn:
#      this option will be used wherever 'fqdn' is needed.
#      simply substitue it in the description above.
#      default: fqdn as returned by the metadata service.  on EC2 'hostname'
#               is used, so this is like: ip-10-244-170-199.ec2.internal
#
# == /etc/hosts management ==
#
# The cloud-config variable that covers management of /etc/hosts is
# 'manage_etc_hosts'
#
# By default, its value is 'false' (boolean False)
#
#  * manage_etc_hosts:
#      default: false
#
#    false:
#      cloud-init will not modify /etc/hosts at all.
#      * Whatever is present at instance boot time will be present after boot.
#      * User changes will not be overwritten
#
#    true:
#      on every boot, /etc/hosts will be re-written from
#      /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl.
#      The strings '$hostname' and '$fqdn' are replaced in the template
#      with the appropriate values.
#      To make modifications persistent across a reboot, you must make
#      modificatoins to /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl
#
#    localhost:
#      This option ensures that an entry is present for fqdn as described in
#      section 5.1.2 of the debian manual
#      http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html
#
#      cloud-init will generally own the 127.0.1.1 entry, and will update
#      it to the hostname and fqdn on every boot.  All other entries will
#      be left as is.  'ping `hostname`' will ping 127.0.1.1
#
#      If you want a fqdn entry with aliases other than 'hostname' to resolve
#      to a localhost interface, you'll need to use something other than
#      127.0.1.1.  For example:
#        127.0.1.2 myhost.fqdn.example.com myhost whatup.example.com

# final_message
# default: cloud-init boot finished at $TIMESTAMP. Up $UPTIME seconds

# phone_home: if this dictionary is present, then the phone_home

# timezone: set the timezone for this instance
# the value of 'timezone' must exist in /usr/share/zoneinfo

# you can set passwords for a user or multiple users
# this is off by default.
# to set the default user's password, use the 'password' option.
# if set, to 'R' or 'RANDOM', then a random password will be
# generated and written to stdout (the console)
# password: passw0rd
#
# also note, that this will expire the password, forcing a change
# on first login. If you do not want to expire, see 'chpasswd' below.
#
# By default in the UEC images password authentication is disabled
# Thus, simply setting 'password' as above will only allow you to login
# via the console.
#
# in order to enable password login via ssh you must set
# 'ssh_pwauth'.
# If it is set, to 'True' or 'False', then sshd_config will be updated
# to ensure the desired function.  If not set, or set to '' or 'unchanged'
# then sshd_config will not be updated.
# ssh_pwauth: True
#
# there is also an option to set multiple users passwords, using 'chpasswd'
# That looks like the following, with 'expire' set to 'True' by default.
# to not expire users passwords, set 'expire' to 'False'. Also possible
# to set hashed password, here account 'user3' has a password it set to
# 'cloud-init', hashed with SHA-256:
# chpasswd:
#   users:
#    - name: user1
#      password: password1
#      type: text
#    - user2
#      type: RANDOM
#    - user3
#      password: $5$eriogqzq$Dg7PxHsKGzziuEGkZgkLvacjuEFeljJ.rLf.hZqKQLA
#      type: hash
#   expire: True
# ssh_pwauth: [ True, False, "" or "unchanged" ]
#
# Hashed passwords can be generated in multiple ways, example with python3 and the passlib module:
# python3 -c 'import passlib.hash;print(passlib.hash.sha512_crypt.hash("password"))'
# Newer versions of 'mkpasswd' will also work: mkpasswd -m sha-512 password
#
# So, a simple working example to allow login via ssh, and not expire
# for the default user would look like:
password: passw0rd
chpasswd: { expire: False }
ssh_pwauth: True

## configure interaction with ssh server
# ssh_svcname: ssh
#    set the name of the option to 'service restart'

#    default: ssh
# ssh_deletekeys: True
#    boolean indicating if existing ssh keys should be deleted on a
#    per-instance basis.  On a public image, this should absolutely be set
#    to 'True'
# ssh_genkeytypes: ['rsa', 'ecdsa']
#    a list of the ssh key types that should be generated
#    These are passed to 'ssh-keygen -t'

## configuration of ssh keys output to console
# ssh_fp_console_blacklist: []
# ssh_key_console_blacklist: [ssh-dss]
#   A list of key types (first token of a /etc/ssh/ssh_key_*.pub file)
#   that should be skipped when outputting key fingerprints and keys
#   to the console respectively.

## poweroff or reboot system after finished
# default: none
#
# power_state can be used to make the system shutdown, reboot or
# halt after boot is finished.  This same thing can be achieved by
# user-data scripts or by runcmd by simply invoking 'shutdown'.
#
# Doing it this way ensures that cloud-init is entirely finished with
# modules that would be executed, and avoids any error/log messages
# that may go to the console as a result of system services like
# syslog being taken down while cloud-init is running.
#
# delay: form accepted by shutdown.  default is 'now'. other format
#        accepted is '+m' (m in minutes)
# mode: required. must be one of 'poweroff', 'halt', 'reboot'
# message: provided as the message argument to 'shutdown'. default is none.
power_state:
  delay: '+30'
  mode: poweroff
  message: Bye Bye
