## hostname and /etc/hosts management
# cloud-init can handle updating some entries in /etc/hosts,
# and can set your hostname for you.
#
# if you do nothing you'll end up with:
#  * /etc/hostname (and `hostname`) managed via: 'preserve_hostame: false'
#    if you do not change /etc/hostname, it will be updated with the cloud
#    provided hostname on each boot.  If you make a change, then manual
#    maintenance takes over, and cloud-init will not modify it.
#
#  * /etc/hosts managed via: 'manage_etc_hosts: false'
#    cloud-init will not manage /etc/hosts at all.  It is in full manual
#    maintenance mode.
#
# You can change the above behavior with the following config variables:
#  Remember that these can be set in cloud-config via user-data,
#  /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or any file in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/
#
# == Hostname management (via /etc/hostname) ==
#  * preserve_hostname:
#      default: False
#      If this option is set to True, then /etc/hostname will never updated
#      The default behavior is to update it if it has not been modified by
#      the user.
#
#  * hostname:
#      this option will be used wherever the 'hostname' is needed
#      simply substitute it in the description above.
#      ** If you wish to set your hostname, set it here **
#      default: 'hostname' as returned by the metadata service
#               on EC2, the hostname portion of 'local-hostname' is used
#               which is something like 'ip-10-244-170-199'
#
#  * fqdn:
#      this option will be used wherever 'fqdn' is needed.
#      simply substitue it in the description above.
#      default: fqdn as returned by the metadata service.  on EC2 'hostname'
#               is used, so this is like: ip-10-244-170-199.ec2.internal
#
# == /etc/hosts management ==
#
# The cloud-config variable that covers management of /etc/hosts is 
# 'manage_etc_hosts'
#
# By default, its value is 'false' (boolean False)
#
#  * manage_etc_hosts:
#      default: false
#
#    false:
#      cloud-init will not modify /etc/hosts at all.  
#      * Whatever is present at instance boot time will be present after boot.
#      * User changes will not be overwritten
#
#    true or 'template':
#      on every boot, /etc/hosts will be re-written from 
#      /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl.
#      The strings '$hostname' and '$fqdn' are replaced in the template
#      with the appropriate values.
#      To make modifications persistant across a reboot, you must make 
#      modificatoins to /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl
#
#    localhost:
#      This option ensures that an entry is present for fqdn as described in
#      section 5.1.2 of the debian manual 
#      http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html
#
#      cloud-init will generally own the 127.0.1.1 entry, and will update 
#      it to the hostname and fqdn on every boot.  All other entries will
#      be left as is.  'ping `hostname`' will ping 127.0.1.1
#
#      If you want a fqdn entry with aliases other than 'hostname' to resolve
#      to a localhost interface, you'll need to use something other than 
#      127.0.1.1.  For example:
#        127.0.1.2 myhost.fqdn.example.com myhost whatup.example.com

# final_message
# default: cloud-init boot finished at $TIMESTAMP. Up $UPTIME seconds
# this message is written by cloud-final when the system is finished

# want jinja, you have to start the line with '## template:jinja\n'
final_message: "The system is finally up, after $UPTIME seconds"

# configure where output will go
# 'output' entry is a dict with 'init', 'config', 'final' or 'all'
# entries.  Each one defines where 
#  cloud-init, cloud-config, cloud-config-final or all output will go
# each entry in the dict can be a string, list or dict.
#  if it is a string, it refers to stdout and stderr
#  if it is a list, entry 0 is stdout, entry 1 is stderr
#  if it is a dict, it is expected to have 'output' and 'error' fields
# default is to write to console only
# the special entry "&1" for an error means "same location as stdout"
#  (Note, that '&1' has meaning in yaml, so it must be quoted)
output:

# def_log_file and syslog_fix_perms work together
# if 
# - logging is set to go to a log file 'L' both with and without syslog

# - and syslog is configured to write to 'L'
# then 'L' will be initially created with root:root ownership (during
# cloud-init), and then at cloud-config time (when syslog is available)
# the syslog daemon will be unable to write to the file.
# 
# to remedy this situation, 'def_log_file' can be set to a filename
# and syslog_fix_perms to a string containing "<user>:<group>"
# if syslog_fix_perms is a list, it will iterate through and use the
# first pair that does not raise error.
#
# the default values are '/var/log/cloud-init.log' and 'syslog:adm'
# the value of 'def_log_file' should match what is configured in logging
# if either is empty, then no change of ownership will be done
def_log_file: /var/log/my-logging-file.log

# you can set passwords for a user or multiple users
# this is off by default.
# to set the default user's password, use the 'password' option.
# if set, to 'R' or 'RANDOM', then a random password will be
# generated and written to stdout (the console)
# password: passw0rd
#
# also note, that this will expire the password, forcing a change
# on first login. If you do not want to expire, see 'chpasswd' below.
#
# By default in the UEC images password authentication is disabled
# Thus, simply setting 'password' as above will only allow you to login
# via the console.
#
# in order to enable password login via ssh you must set
# 'ssh_pwauth'.
# If it is set, to 'True' or 'False', then sshd_config will be updated
# to ensure the desired function.  If not set, or set to '' or 'unchanged'
# then sshd_config will not be updated.
# ssh_pwauth: True
#
# there is also an option to set multiple users passwords, using 'chpasswd'
# That looks like the following, with 'expire' set to 'True' by default.
# to not expire users passwords, set 'expire' to 'False'. Also possible
# to set hashed password, here account 'user3' has a password it set to
# 'cloud-init', hashed with SHA-256:
# chpasswd:
#  list: |
#    user1:password1
#    user2:RANDOM
#    user3:$5$eriogqzq$Dg7PxHsKGzziuEGkZgkLvacjuEFeljJ.rLf.hZqKQLA
#  expire: True
# ssh_pwauth: [ True, False, "" or "unchanged" ]
#
# Hashed passwords can be generated in multiple ways, example with python3:
# python3 -c 'import crypt,getpass; print(crypt.crypt(getpass.getpass(), crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))'
# Newer versions of 'mkpasswd' will also work: mkpasswd -m sha-512 password
#
# So, a simple working example to allow login via ssh, and not expire
# for the default user would look like:
password: passw0rd
chpasswd: { expire: False }
ssh_pwauth: True

# manual cache clean.
#  By default, the link from /var/lib/cloud/instance to
#  the specific instance in /var/lib/cloud/instances/ is removed on every

#  if your DataSource will not be present on every boot, then you can set
#  this option to 'True', and maintain (remove) that link before the image
#  will be booted as a new instance.
# default is False
manual_cache_clean: False

# When cloud-init is finished running including having run 
# cloud_init_modules, then it will run this command.  The default
# is to emit an upstart signal as shown below.  If the value is a
# list, it will be passed to Popen.  If it is a string, it will be
# invoked through 'sh -c'.
# 
# default value:
# cc_ready_cmd: [ initctl, emit, cloud-config, CLOUD_CFG=/var/lib/instance//cloud-config.txt ]
# example:
# cc_ready_cmd: [ sh, -c, 'echo HI MOM > /tmp/file' ]

## configure interaction with ssh server
# ssh_svcname: ssh
#    set the name of the option to 'service restart'
#    in order to restart the ssh daemon. For fedora, use 'sshd'
#    default: ssh
# ssh_deletekeys: True
#    boolean indicating if existing ssh keys should be deleted on a
#    per-instance basis.  On a public image, this should absolutely be set
#    to 'True'
# ssh_genkeytypes: ['rsa', 'dsa', 'ecdsa']
#    a list of the ssh key types that should be generated
#    These are passed to 'ssh-keygen -t'

## configuration of ssh keys output to console
# ssh_fp_console_blacklist: []
# ssh_key_console_blacklist: [ssh-dss]
#   A list of key types (first token of a /etc/ssh/ssh_key_*.pub file)
#   that should be skipped when outputting key fingerprints and keys
#   to the console respectively.

## poweroff or reboot system after finished
# default: none
#
# power_state can be used to make the system shutdown, reboot or
# halt after boot is finished.  This same thing can be acheived by
# user-data scripts or by runcmd by simply invoking 'shutdown'.
# 
# Doing it this way ensures that cloud-init is entirely finished with
# modules that would be executed, and avoids any error/log messages
# that may go to the console as a result of system services like
# syslog being taken down while cloud-init is running.
#
