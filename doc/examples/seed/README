This directory is an example of a 'seed' directory.


copying these files inside an instance's
  /var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud
or
  /var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud-net

will cause the 'DataSourceNoCloud' and 'DataSourceNoCloudNet' modules
to enable and read the given data.

The directory must have both files.

- user-data:
  This is the user data, as would be consumed from ec2's metadata service
  see examples in doc/examples.
- meta-data:
  This file is yaml formated data similar to what is in the ec2 metadata
  service under meta-data/.  See the example, or, on an ec2 instance,
  run:
     python -c 'import boto.utils, yaml; print(
        yaml.dump(boto.utils.get_instance_metadata()))'
