#cloud-config

# Add apt repositories
#
# Default: auto select based on cloud metadata
#  in ec2, the default is <region>.archive.ubuntu.com
# apt:
#   primary:
#     - arches [default]
#       uri:
#     use the provided mirror
#       search:
#     search the list for the first mirror.
#     this is currently very limited, only verifying that
#     the mirror is dns resolvable or an IP address
#
# if neither mirror is set (the default)
# then use the mirror provided by the DataSource found.
# In EC2, that means using <region>.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com
#
# if no mirror is provided by the DataSource, but 'search_dns' is
# true, then search for dns names '<distro>-mirror' in each of
# - fqdn of this host per cloud metadata
# - localdomain
# - no domain (which would search domains listed in /etc/resolv.conf)
# If there is a dns entry for <distro>-mirror, then it is assumed that there
# is a distro mirror at http://<distro>-mirror.<domain>/<distro>
#
# That gives the cloud provider the opportunity to set mirrors of a distro
# up and expose them only by creating dns entries.
#
# if none of that is found, then the default distro mirror is used
