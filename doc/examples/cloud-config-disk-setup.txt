# "disk_setup": disk partitioning
# --------------------------------

# The disk_setup directive instructs Cloud-init to partition a disk. The format is:

disk_setup:
   ephmeral0:
       table_type: 'mbr'
       layout: 'auto'
   /dev/xvdh:
       table_type: 'mbr'
       layout:
           - 33
           - [33, 82]
           - 33
       overwrite: True

# The format is a list of dicts of dicts. The first value is the name of the
# device and the subsequent values define how to create and layout the
# partition.
# The general format is:
#    disk_setup:
#        <DEVICE>:
#            table_type: 'mbr'
#            layout: <LAYOUT|BOOL>
#            overwrite: <BOOL>
#
# Where:
#    <DEVICE>: The name of the device. 'ephemeralX' and 'swap' are special
#                values which are specific to the cloud. For these devices
#                Cloud-init will look up what the real devices is and then
#                use it.
#
#                For other devices, the kernel device name is used. At this
#                time only simply kernel devices are supported, meaning
#                that device mapper and other targets may not work.
#
#                Note: At this time, there is no handling or setup of
#                device mapper targets.
#
#    table_type=<TYPE>: Currently the following are supported:
#                    'mbr': default and setups a MS-DOS partition table
#
#                Note: At this time only 'mbr' partition tables are allowed.
#                    It is anticipated in the future that we'll have GPT as
#                    option in the future, or even "RAID" to create a mdadm
#                    RAID.
#
#    layout={...}: The device layout. This is a list of values, with the
#                percentage of disk that partition will take.
#                Valid options are:
#                    [<SIZE>, [<SIZE>, <PART_TYPE]]
#
#                Where <SIZE> is the _percentage_ of the disk to use, while
#                <PART_TYPE> is the numerical value of the partition type.
#
#                The following setups two partitions, with the first
#                partition having a swap label, taking 1/3 of the disk space
#                and the remainder being used as the second partition.
#                    /dev/xvdh':
#                        table_type: 'mbr'
#                        layout:
#                            - [33,82]
#                            - 66
#                        overwrite: True
#
#                When layout is "true" it means single partition the entire
#                device.
#
#                When layout is "false" it means don't partition or ignore
#                existing partitioning.
#
#                If layout is set to "true" and overwrite is set to "false",
#                it will skip partitioning the device without a failure.
#
#    overwrite=<BOOL>: This describes whether to ride with saftey's on and
#                everything holstered.
#
#                'false' is the default, which means that:
#                    1. The device will be checked for a partition table
#                    2. The device will be checked for a file system
#                    3. If either a partition of file system is found, then
#                        the operation will be _skipped_.
#
#                'true' is cowboy mode. There are no checks and things are
#                    done blindly. USE with caution, you can do things you
#                    really, really don't want to do.
#
#
# fs_setup: Setup the file system
# -------------------------------
#
# fs_setup describes the how the file systems are supposed to look.

fs_setup:
   - label: ephemeral0
     filesystem: 'ext3'
     device: 'ephemeral0'
     partition: 'auto'
   - label:  mylabl2
     filesystem: 'ext4'
     device: '/dev/xvda1'
   - special:
     cmd: mkfs -t %(FILESYSTEM)s -L %(LABEL)s %(DEVICE)s
     filesystem: 'btrfs'
     device: '/dev/xvdh'

# The general format is:
#    fs_setup:
#        - label: <LABEL>
#          filesystem: <FS_TYPE>
#          device: <DEVICE>
#          partition: <PART_VALUE>
#          overwrite: <OVERWRITE>
#          replace_fs: <FS_TYPE>
#
# Where:
#     <LABEL>: The file system label to be used. If set to None, no label is
#        used.
#
#    <FS_TYPE>: The file system type. It is assumed that the there
#        will be a "mkfs.<FS_TYPE>" that behaves likes "mkfs". On a standard
#        Ubuntu Cloud Image, this means that you have the option of ext{2,3,4},
#        and vfat by default.
#
#    <DEVICE>: The device name. Special names of 'ephemeralX' or 'swap'
#        are allowed and the actual device is acquired from the cloud datasource.
#        When using 'ephemeralX' (i.e. ephemeral0), make sure to leave the
#        label as 'ephemeralX' otherwise there may be issues with the mounting
#        of the ephemeral storage layer.
#
#        If you define the device as 'ephemeralX.Y' then Y will be interpetted
#        as a partition value. However, ephermalX.0 is the _same_ as ephemeralX.
#
#    <PART_VALUE>:
#        Partition definitions are overwriten if you use the '<DEVICE>.Y' notation.
#
#        The valid options are:
#        "auto|any": tell cloud-init not to care whether there is a partition
#            or not. Auto will use the first partition that does not contain a
#            file system already. In the absence of a partition table, it will
#            put it directly on the disk.
#
#            "auto": If a file system that matches the specification in terms of
#            label, type and device, then cloud-init will skip the creation of
#            the file system.
#
#            "any": If a file system that matches the file system type and device,
#            then cloud-init will skip the creation of the file system.
#
#            Devices are selected based on first-detected, starting with partitions
#            and then the raw disk. Consider the following:
#                NAME     FSTYPE LABEL
#                xvdb
#                |-xvdb1  ext4
#                |-xvdb2
#                |-xvdb3  btrfs  test
#                \-xvdb4  ext4   test
#
#            If you ask for 'auto', label of 'test, and file system of 'ext4'
#            then cloud-init will select the 2nd partition, even though there
#            is a partition match at the 4th partition.
#
#            If you ask for 'any' and a label of 'test', then cloud-init will
#            select the 1st partition.
#
#            If you ask for 'auto' and don't define label, then cloud-init will
#            select the 1st partition.
#
#            In general, if you have a specific partition configuration in mind,
#            you should define either the device or the partition number. 'auto'
#            and 'any' are specifically intended for formating ephemeral storage or
#            for simple schemes.
#
#        "none": Put the file system directly on the device.
#
#        <NUM>: where NUM is the actual partition number.
#
#    <OVERWRITE>: Defines whether or not to overwrite any existing
#        filesystem.
#
#        "true": Indiscriminately destroy any pre-existing file system. Use at
#            your own peril.
#
#        "false": If an existing file system exists, skip the creation.
#
#    <REPLACE_FS>: This is a special directive, used for Windows Azure that
#        instructs cloud-init to replace a file system of <FS_TYPE>. NOTE:
#        unless you define a label, this requires the use of the 'any' partition
#        directive.
#
# Behavior Caveat: The default behavior is to _check_ if the file system exists.
#    If a file system matches the specification, then the operation is a no-op.
