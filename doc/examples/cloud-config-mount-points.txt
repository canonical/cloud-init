# set up mount points
# 'mounts' contains a list of lists
#  the inner list are entries for an /etc/fstab line
#  ie : [ fs_spec, fs_file, fs_vfstype, fs_mntops, fs-freq, fs_passno ]
#
# default:
# mounts:
#  - [ ephemeral0, /mnt ]
#  - [ swap, none, swap, sw, 0, 0 ]
#
# in order to remove a previously listed mount (ie, one from defaults)
# list only the fs_spec.  For example, to override the default, of
# mounting swap:
# - [ swap ]
# or
# - [ swap, null ]
#
# - if a device does not exist at the time, an entry will still be
#   written to /etc/fstab.
# - '/dev' can be ommitted for device names that begin with: xvd, sd, hd, vd
# - if an entry does not have all 6 fields, they will be filled in
#   with values from 'mount_default_fields' below.
#
# Note, that you should set 'nofail' (see man fstab) for volumes that may not
# be attached at instance boot (or reboot).
#
mounts:
 - [ ephemeral0, /mnt, auto, "defaults,noexec" ]
 - [ sdc, /opt/data ]
 - [ xvdh, /opt/data, "auto", "defaults,nofail", "0", "0" ]
 - [ dd, /dev/zero ]

# mount_default_fields
# These values are used to fill in any entries in 'mounts' that are not
# complete.  This must be an array, and must have 6 fields.
mount_default_fields: [ None, None, "auto", "defaults,nofail", "0", "2" ]


# swap can also be set up by the 'mounts' module
# default is to not create any swap files, because 'size' is set to 0
swap:
  filename: /swap.img
  size: "auto" # or size in bytes
  maxsize: size in bytes
