=== Overview ===
Userdata is data provided by the entity that launches an instance.
The cloud provider makes this data available to the instance via in one
way or another.

In EC2, the data is provided by the user via the '--user-data' or
'user-data-file' argument to ec2-run-instances.  The EC2 cloud makes the
data available to the instance via its instance metadata service at
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

cloud-init can read this input and act on it in different ways.

=== Input Formats ===
cloud-init will download and cache to filesystem any user-data that it
finds.  However, certain types of user-data are handled specially.

 * Gzip Compressed Content
   content found to be gzip compressed will be uncompressed, and
   these rules applied to the uncompressed data

 * Mime Multi Part archive
   This list of rules is applied to each part of this multi-part file
   Using a mime-multi part file, the user can specify more than one
   type of data.  For example, both a user data script and a
   cloud-config type could be specified.

 * User-Data Script
   begins with: #!            or Content-Type: text/x-shellscript
   script will be executed at "rc.local-like" level during first boot.
   rc.local-like means "very late in the boot sequence"

 * Include File
   begins with  #include      or Content-Type: text/x-include-url
   This content is a "include" file.  The file contains a list of
   urls, one per line.  Each of the URLs will be read, and their content
   will be passed through this same set of rules.  Ie, the content
   read from the URL can be gzipped, mime-multi-part, or plain text

* Include File Once
   begins with  #include-once      or Content-Type: text/x-include-once-url
   This content is a "include" file.  The file contains a list of
   urls, one per line.  Each of the URLs will be read, and their content
   will be passed through this same set of rules.  Ie, the content
   read from the URL can be gzipped, mime-multi-part, or plain text
   This file will just be downloaded only once per instance, and its
   contents cached for subsequent boots.  This allows you to pass in
   one-time-use or expiring URLs.

 * Cloud Config Data
   begins with  #cloud-config or Content-Type: text/cloud-config

   This content is "cloud-config" data.  See the examples for a
   commented example of supported config formats.

 * Cloud Boothook
   begins with #cloud-boothook or Content-Type: text/cloud-boothook

   This content is "boothook" data.  It is stored in a file under
   ``/var/lib/cloud`` and then executed immediately.

   This is the earliest "hook" available.  Note, that there is no
   mechanism provided for running only once.  The boothook must take
   care of this itself.

=== Sentive values ===
Sharing secret in plain text in userdata is generally considered unsafe 
(example in AWS documentation[1]). This is because user-data can usally 
be read back, often with a simple "read" permission, allowing a user with 
limited access to discover potentially sensitive secrets on existing 
deploying VM.

A common pattern is to leverage managed secret services from cloud 
providers, along with an instance profile. However, this often implies 
multiple elements, such as cloud specific logic to provision and manage 
the secrets, as well as fetching them inside the VM instance. In may also 
induce costs and create a potential attack vector as the VM will be able 
to operate on the cloud provider API, and for example, perform denial of 
service attach by consuming operqtional quota.

When using the jinja templating, it is possible to pass encrypted 
sensitive value with GPG and decrypt them at runtime, using the 
`gpgdecrypt`. This requires to install to install the GPG key with 
"encrypt" usage prior, for example during the baking processing of the 
VM image.

"gpgdecrypt" function takes one required argument and one optional. The 
first argument is the base64-encoded encrypted data to decrypt, and the 
second argument is the default value, to return in case the decryption 
process fail.

Here is a complete example:

```
## template: jinja
runcmd:
- mkdir -p /var/run/secrets/example.com
- echo "{{ gpgdecrypt("bG9yZW0gaXBzdW0K") }}" > /var/run/secrets/example.com/mykey.pem
```

=== Examples ===
There are examples in the examples subdirectory.
Additionally, the 'tools' directory contains 'write-mime-multipart',
which can be used to easily generate mime-multi-part files from a list
of input files.  That data can then be given to an instance.

See 'write-mime-multipart --help' for usage.
