cc_scripts_per_instance:
  description: |
    Any scripts in the ``scripts/per-instance`` directory on the datasource
    will be run when a new instance is first booted. Scripts will be run in
    alphabetical order. This module does not accept any config keys.

    Some cloud platforms change ``instance-id`` if a significant change was
    made to the system. As a result, per-instance scripts will run again.
