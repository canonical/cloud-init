cc_yum_add_repo:
  description: |
    Add yum repository configuration to ``/etc/yum.repos.d``. Configuration
    files are named based on the opaque dictionary key under the ``yum_repos``
    they are specified with. If a config file already exists with the same
    name as a config entry, the config entry will be skipped.

      Example 2: Enable cloud-init upstream's daily testing repo for EPEL 8 to
      install the latest cloud-init from tip of ``main`` for testing.
    file: cc_yum_add_repo/example2.yaml
  - comment: >
      Example 3: Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/epel_testing.repo`` which can
      then subsequently be used by yum for later operations.
    file: cc_yum_add_repo/example3.yaml
  - comment: >
      Example 4: Any yum repo configuration can be passed directly into the
      repository file created. See ``man yum.conf`` for supported config keys.

      Write ``/etc/yum.conf.d/my-package-stream.repo`` with ``gpgkey`` checks
      on the repo data of the repository enabled.
