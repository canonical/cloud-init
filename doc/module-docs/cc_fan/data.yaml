cc_fan:
  description: |
    This module installs, configures and starts the Ubuntu fan network
    system (`Read more about Ubuntu Fan <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FanNetworking>`_).

    If cloud-init sees a ``fan`` entry in cloud-config it will:

    - Write ``config_path`` with the contents of the ``config`` key
    - Install the package ``ubuntu-fan`` if it is not installed
    - Ensure the service is started (or restarted if was previously running)

    Additionally, the ``ubuntu-fan`` package will be automatically installed
    if not present.
