    For more information about Ubuntu Fan, see:

    ``https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FanNetworking``.


    If cloud-init sees a ``fan`` entry in cloud-config it will:


    - write ``config_path`` with the contents of the ``config`` key

    - install the package ``ubuntu-fan`` if it is not installed

    - ensure the service is started (or restarted if was previously running)


    Additionally, the ``ubuntu-fan`` package will be automatically installed

    if not present.
