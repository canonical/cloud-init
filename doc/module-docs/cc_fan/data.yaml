    For more information about Ubuntu Fan, see:
    ``https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FanNetworking``.

    If cloud-init sees a ``fan`` entry in cloud-config it will:

    - write ``config_path`` with the contents of the ``config`` key
    - install the package ``ubuntu-fan`` if it is not installed
    - ensure the service is started (or restarted if was previously running)

    Additionally, the ``ubuntu-fan`` package will be automatically installed
    if not present.
