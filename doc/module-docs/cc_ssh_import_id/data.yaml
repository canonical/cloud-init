cc_ssh_import_id:
  description: |
    This module imports SSH keys from either a public keyserver (usually
    Launchpad), or GitHub, using ``ssh-import-id``. Keys are referenced by the
    username they are associated with on the keyserver. The keyserver can be
    specified by prepending either ``lp:`` for Launchpad or ``gh:`` for
    GitHub to the username.
