cc_seed_random:
  description: |
    All cloud instances started from the same image will produce similar data
    when they are first booted as they are all starting with the same
    seed for the kernel's entropy keyring. To avoid this, random seed data can
    be provided to the instance, either as a string or by specifying a command
    to run to generate the data.

    Configuration for this module is under the ``random_seed`` config key. If
    the cloud provides its own random seed data, it will be appended to
    ``data`` before it is written to ``file``.

    If the ``command`` key is specified, the given command will be executed.
    This will happen after ``file`` has been populated. That command's
    environment will contain the value of the ``file`` key as
    ``RANDOM_SEED_FILE``. If a command is specified that cannot be run, no
    error will be reported unless ``command_required`` is set to ``true``.

      Example 2: Use ``pollinate`` to gather data from a remote entropy
      server and write it to ``/dev/urandom``:
    file: cc_seed_random/example2.yaml
  name: Seed Random
  title: Provide random seed data
