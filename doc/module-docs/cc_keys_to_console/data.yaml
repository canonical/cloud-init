cc_keys_to_console:
  description: |
    For security reasons it may be desirable not to write SSH host keys and
    their fingerprints to the console. To avoid either of them being written
    to the console, the ``emit_keys_to_console`` config key under the main
    ``ssh`` config key can be used.

    To avoid the fingerprint of types of SSH host keys being written to
    console the ``ssh_fp_console_blacklist`` config key can be used. By
    default, all types of keys will have their fingerprints written to console.

    To avoid host keys of a key type being written to console the
    ``ssh_key_console_blacklist`` config key can be used. By default,
    all supported host keys are written to console.
