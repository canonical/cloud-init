cc_keys_to_console:
  description: 'For security reasons it may be desirable not to write SSH host keys

    and their fingerprints to the console. To avoid either being written

    to the console the ``emit_keys_to_console`` config key under the

    main ``ssh`` config key can be used. To avoid the fingerprint of

    types of SSH host keys being written to console the

    ``ssh_fp_console_blacklist`` config key can be used. By default,

    all types of keys will have their fingerprints written to console.

    To avoid host keys of a key type being written to console the

    ``ssh_key_console_blacklist`` config key can be used. By default

    all supported host keys are written to console.
