  description: 'Handle ntp configuration. If ntp is not installed on the system and

    ntp configuration is specified, ntp will be installed. If there is a

    default ntp config file in the image or one is present in the

    distro''s ntp package, it will be copied to a file with ``.dist``

    appended to the filename before any changes are made. A list of ntp

    pools and ntp servers can be provided under the ``ntp`` config key.

    If no ntp ``servers`` or ``pools`` are provided, 4 pools will be used

    in the format ``{0-3}.{distro}.pool.ntp.org``.
