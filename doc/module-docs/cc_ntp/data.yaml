cc_ntp:
  description: |
    Handle Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration. If ``ntp`` is not
    installed on the system and NTP configuration is specified, ``ntp`` will
    be installed.

    If there is a default NTP config file in the image or one is present in the
    distro's ``ntp`` package, it will be copied to a file with ``.dist``
    appended to the filename before any changes are made.

    A list of NTP pools and NTP servers can be provided under the ``ntp``
    config key.

    If no NTP ``servers`` or ``pools`` are provided, 4 pools will be used
    in the format:

    ``{0-3}.{distro}.pool.ntp.org``
