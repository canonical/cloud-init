cc_set_passwords:
  description: |
    This module consumes three top-level config keys: ``ssh_pwauth``,
    ``chpasswd`` and ``password``.
    
    The ``ssh_pwauth`` config key determines whether or not sshd will be
    configured to accept password authentication. Disabling SSH password
    authentication is limited to setting the specific sshd_config value
    ``PasswordAuthentication no`` in sshd_config.

    .. note::
       If your image uses PAM for authentication, providing
       ``PasswordAuthentication no`` may not be sufficient if your
       distribution default is to provide ``KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes``
       in sshd_config. See Example 3 for suggested user-data in this case.
    
    The ``chpasswd`` config key accepts a dictionary containing either (or
    both) of ``users`` and ``expire``.
    
    - The ``users`` key is used to assign a password to a corresponding
      pre-existing user.
    - The ``expire`` key is used to set whether to expire all user passwords
      specified by this module, such that a password will need to be reset on
      the user's next login.
    
    .. note::
       Prior to cloud-init 22.3, the ``expire`` key only applies to plain text
       (including ``RANDOM``) passwords. Post-22.3, the ``expire`` key applies
       to both plain text and hashed passwords.

    The ``password`` config key is used to set the default user's password. It
    is ignored if the ``chpasswd`` ``users`` is used. Note that the ``list``
    keyword is deprecated in favor of ``users``.

      Example 1: Set a default password, to be changed at first login.

      Example 2:
      - Disable SSH password authentication.
      - Don't require users to change their passwords on next login.
      - Set the password for user1 to be 'password1' (OS does hashing).
      - Set the password for user2 to a pre-hashed password.
      - Set the password for user3 to be a randomly generated password, which
        will be written to the system console.
      - Set the password for user4 to be a randomly generated password.
        This "friendly" style of random password will be generated without
        punctuation or characters which are likely to be ambiguous to
        human readers and will be written to the system console.

      Example 3: Disable SSH password authentication and PAM interactive
      password authentication by manually supplementing cloud-init's default
      sshd_config.
