cc_set_passwords:
  description: "This module consumes three top-level config keys: ``ssh_pwauth``,\n\
    ``chpasswd`` and ``password``.\n\nThe ``ssh_pwauth`` config key determines whether\
    \ or not sshd will be\nconfigured to accept password authentication.\n\nThe ``chpasswd``\
    \ config key accepts a dictionary containing either (or\nboth) of ``users`` and\
    \ ``expire``. The ``users`` key is used to assign a\npassword to a corresponding\
    \ pre-existing user. The ``expire`` key is used\nto set whether to expire all\
    \ user passwords specified by this module, such\nthat a password will need to\
    \ be reset on the user's next login.\n\n.. note::\n   Prior to cloud-init 22.3,\
    \ the ``expire`` key only applies to plain text\n   (including ``RANDOM``) passwords.\
    \ Post 22.3, the ``expire`` key applies\n   to both plain text and hashed passwords.\n\
    \nThe ``password`` config key is used to set the default user's password. It\n\
    is ignored if the ``chpasswd`` ``users`` is used. Note that the ``list``\nkeyword\
    \ is deprecated in favor of ``users``.\n"

  - comment: "- Disable SSH password authentication.\n- Don't require users to change\
      \ their passwords on next login.\n- Set the password for user1 to be 'password1'\
      \ (OS does hashing).\n- Set the password for user2 to a pre-hashed password.\n\
      - Set the password for user3 to be a randomly generated password, which\n  will\
      \ be written to the system console.\n"
