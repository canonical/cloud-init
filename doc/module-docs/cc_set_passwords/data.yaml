cc_set_passwords:
  description: |
    This module consumes three top-level config keys: ``ssh_pwauth``,
    ``chpasswd`` and ``password``.
    
    The ``ssh_pwauth`` config key determines whether or not sshd will be
    configured to accept password authentication.
    
    The ``chpasswd`` config key accepts a dictionary containing either (or
    both) of ``users`` and ``expire``.
    
    - The ``users`` key is used to assign a password to a corresponding
      pre-existing user.
    - The ``expire`` key is used to set whether to expire all user passwords
      specified by this module, such that a password will need to be reset on
      the user's next login.
    
    .. note::
       Prior to cloud-init 22.3, the ``expire`` key only applies to plain text
       (including ``RANDOM``) passwords. Post-22.3, the ``expire`` key applies
       to both plain text and hashed passwords.

    The ``password`` config key is used to set the default user's password. It
    is ignored if the ``chpasswd`` ``users`` is used. Note that the ``list``
    keyword is deprecated in favor of ``users``.

      Example 1: Set a default password, to be changed at first login.
    file: cc_set_passwords/example1.yaml

      Example 2:
      - Disable SSH password authentication.
      - Don't require users to change their passwords on next login.
      - Set the password for user1 to be 'password1' (OS does hashing).
      - Set the password for user2 to a pre-hashed password.
      - Set the password for user3 to be a randomly generated password, which
        will be written to the system console.
