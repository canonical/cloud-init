cc_scripts_per_once:
  name: Scripts Per Once
  title: Run one-time scripts
  description: |
    Any scripts in the ``scripts/per-once`` directory on the datasource will
    be run only once. Changes to the instance will not force a re-run. The
    only way to re-run these scripts is to run the ``clean`` subcommand and
    reboot. Scripts will be run in alphabetical order. This module does not
    accept any config keys.
