cc_set_hostname:
  description: "This module handles setting the system hostname and fully qualified\
    \ domain\nname (FQDN). If ``preserve_hostname`` is set, then the hostname will\
    \ not\nbe altered.\n\nA hostname and FQDN can be provided by specifying a full\
    \ domain name under\nthe ``fqdn`` key. Alternatively, a hostname can be specified\
    \ using the\n``hostname`` key, and the FQDN of the cloud will be used. If a FQDN\
    \ is\nspecified with the ``hostname`` key, it will be handled properly, although\n\
    it is better to use the ``fqdn`` config key. If both ``fqdn`` and\n``hostname``\
    \ are set, then ``prefer_fqdn_over_hostname`` will force the\nuse of FQDN in all\
    \ distros when true, and when false it will force the\nshort hostname. Otherwise,\
    \ the hostname to use is distro-dependent.\n\n.. note::\n   Cloud-init performs\
    \ no hostname input validation before sending the\n   hostname to distro-specific\
    \ tools, and most tools will not accept a\n   trailing dot on the FQDN.\n\nThis\
    \ module will run in the init-local stage before networking is\nconfigured if\
    \ the hostname is set by metadata or user data on the local\nsystem.\n\nThis will\
    \ occur on datasources like NoCloud and OVF where metadata and\nuser data are\
    \ available locally. This ensures that the desired hostname is\napplied before\
    \ any DHCP requests are performed on these platforms where\ndynamic DNS is based\
    \ on initial hostname.\n"

      most

      clouds, this will result in a DHCP-configured hostname provided by the

      cloud.
