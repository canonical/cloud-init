cc_salt_minion:
  description: |
    This module installs, configures and starts Salt Minion. If the
    ``salt_minion`` key is present in the config parts, then Salt Minion will
    be installed and started.

    Configuration for Salt Minion can be specified in the ``conf`` key under
    ``salt_minion``. Any config values present there will be assigned in
    ``/etc/salt/minion``. The public and private keys to use for Salt Minion
    can be specified with ``public_key`` and ``private_key`` respectively.

    If you have a custom package name, service name, or config directory, you
    can specify them with ``pkg_name``, ``service_name``, and ``config_dir``
    respectively.

    Salt keys can be manually generated by ``salt-key --gen-keys=GEN_KEYS``,
    where ``GEN_KEYS`` is the name of the keypair, e.g. ''minion''. The keypair
    will be copied to ``/etc/salt/pki`` on the Minion instance.
