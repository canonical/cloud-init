cc_mcollective:
  description: |
    This module installs, configures and starts MCollective. If the
    ``mcollective`` key is present in config, then MCollective will be
    installed and started.
    
    Configuration for ``mcollective`` can be specified in the ``conf`` key
    under ``mcollective``. Each config value consists of a key-value pair and
    will be written to ``/etc/mcollective/server.cfg``. The ``public-cert``
    and ``private-cert`` keys, if present in conf may be used to specify the
    public and private certificates for MCollective. Their values will be
    written to ``/etc/mcollective/ssl/server-public.pem`` and
    ``/etc/mcollective/ssl/server-private.pem``.

    .. warning::
       The EC2 metadata service is a network service and thus is readable by
       non-root users on the system (i.e., ``ec2metadata --user-data``). If
       security is a concern, use ``include-once`` and SSL URLS.
