  description: "This module installs, configures and starts mcollective. If the\n\
    ``mcollective`` key is present in config, then mcollective will be\ninstalled\
    \ and started.\n\nConfiguration for ``mcollective`` can be specified in the ``conf``\
    \ key\nunder ``mcollective``. Each config value consists of a key value pair and\n\
    will be written to ``/etc/mcollective/server.cfg``. The ``public-cert``\nand ``private-cert``\
    \ keys, if present in conf may be used to specify the\npublic and  private certificates\
    \ for mcollective. Their values will be\nwritten to ``/etc/mcollective/ssl/server-public.pem``\
    \ and\n``/etc/mcollective/ssl/server-private.pem``.\n\n.. note::\n    The ec2\
    \ metadata service is readable by non-root users.\n    If security is a concern,\
    \ use include-once and ssl urls.\n"
  examples:
  - comment: "Provide server private and public key and provide the following\nconfig\
      \ settings in /etc/mcollective/server.cfg:\n  loglevel: debug\n  plugin.stomp.host:\
      \ dbhost\n\n.. warning::\n  The ec2 metadata service is a network service, and\
      \ thus is\n  readable by non-root users on the system\n  (ie: 'ec2metadata --user-data')\n\
      \  If you want security for this, please use include-once + SSL urls\n"
