cc_apt_configure:
  description: |
    This module handles configuration of advanced package tool (APT) options
    and adding source lists. There are configuration options such as
    `apt_get_wrapper`` and ``apt_get_command`` that control how cloud-init
    invokes ``apt-get``. These configuration options are handled on a
    per-distro basis, so consult documentation for cloud-init's distro support
    for instructions on using these config options.
    
    By default, cloud-init will generate default APT sources information in
    ``deb822`` format at :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/<distro>.sources`. When
    the value of ``sources_list`` does not appear to be ``deb822`` format, or
    stable distribution releases disable ``deb822`` format,
    :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` will be written instead.
    
    .. note::
       To ensure that APT configuration is valid YAML, any strings containing
       special characters, especially colons, should be quoted (":").
       
    .. note::
       For more information about APT configuration, see the "Additional APT
       configuration" example.

      Example 2: Cloud-init version 23.4 will generate a ``deb822``-formatted
      ``sources`` file at ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/<distro>.sources`` instead
      of ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` when ``sources_list`` content is in
      ``deb822`` format.
