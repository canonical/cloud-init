cc_write_files:
  description: |
    Write out arbitrary content to files, optionally setting permissions.
    Parent folders in the path are created if absent. Content can be specified
    in plain text or binary. Data encoded with either base64 or binary gzip
    data can be specified and will be decoded before being written. For empty
    file creation, content can be omitted.

    .. note::
       If multi-line data is provided, care should be taken to ensure it
       follows YAML formatting standards. To specify binary data, use the YAML
       option ``!!binary``.

    .. note::
       Do not write files under ``/tmp`` during boot because of a race with
       ``systemd-tmpfiles-clean`` that can cause temporary files to be cleaned
       during the early boot process. Use ``/run/somedir`` instead to avoid
       a race (LP: #1707222).

    .. warning::
       Existing files will be overridden.
