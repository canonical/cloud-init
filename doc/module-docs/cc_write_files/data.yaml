cc_write_files:
  description: "Write out arbitrary content to files, optionally setting permissions.\n\
    Parent folders in the path are created if absent. Content can be specified\nin\
    \ plain text or binary. Data encoded with either base64 or binary gzip\ndata can\
    \ be specified and will be decoded before being written. For empty\nfile creation,\
    \ content can be omitted.\n\n.. note::\n   If multi-line data is provided, care\
    \ should be taken to ensure it\n   follows YAML formatting standards. To specify\
    \ binary data, use the YAML\n   option ``!!binary``.\n\n.. note::\n   Do not write\
    \ files under ``/tmp`` during boot because of a race with\n   ``systemd-tmpfiles-clean``\
    \ that can cause temporary files to be cleaned\n   during the early boot process.\
    \ Use ``/run/somedir`` instead to avoid\n   a race LP \\#1707222.\n\n.. warning::\n\
    \   Existing files will be overridden.\n"
