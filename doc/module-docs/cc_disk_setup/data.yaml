cc_disk_setup:
  description: "This module is able to configure simple partition tables and filesystems.\n\
    \n.. note::\n   for more detail about configuration options for disk setup, see\
    \ the disk\n   setup example\n\n.. note::\n   if a swap partition is being created\
    \ via ``disk_setup`` then a\n   ``fs_entry`` entry is also needed in order for\
    \ mkswap to be run,\n   otherwise when swap activation is later attempted it will\
    \ fail.\n\nFor convenience, aliases can be specified for disks using the\n``device_aliases``\
    \ config key, which takes a dictionary of alias: path\nmappings. There are automatic\
    \ aliases for ``swap`` and ``ephemeral<X>``, where\n``swap`` will always refer\
    \ to the active swap partition and ``ephemeral<X>``\nwill refer to the block device\
    \ of the ephemeral image.\n\nDisk partitioning is done using the ``disk_setup``\
    \ directive. This config\ndirective accepts a dictionary where each key is either\
    \ a path to a block\ndevice or an alias specified in ``device_aliases``, and each\
    \ value is the\nconfiguration options for the device. File system configuration\
    \ is done using\nthe ``fs_setup`` directive. This config directive accepts a list\
    \ of\nfilesystem configs.\n"
