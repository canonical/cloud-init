cc_disk_setup:
  description: |
    This module configures simple partition tables and filesystems.
    
    .. note::
       For more detail about configuration options for disk setup, see the
       disk setup example.

    .. note::
       If a swap partition is being created via ``disk_setup``, then an
       ``fs_entry`` entry is also needed in order for ``mkswap`` to be run,
       otherwise when swap activation is later attempted it will fail.
    
    For convenience, aliases can be specified for disks using the
    ``device_aliases`` config key, which takes a dictionary of ``alias: path``
    mappings. There are automatic aliases for ``swap`` and ``ephemeral<X>``,
    where ``swap`` will always refer to the active swap partition and
    ``ephemeral<X>`` will refer to the block device of the ephemeral image.

    Disk partitioning is done using the ``disk_setup`` directive. This config
    directive accepts a dictionary where each key is either a path to a
    block device or an alias specified in ``device_aliases``, and each value is
    the configuration options for the device. File system configuration is done
    using the ``fs_setup`` directive. This config directive accepts a list of
    filesystem configs.
