    Attach machine to an existing Ubuntu Pro support contract and enable or
    disable support services such as Livepatch, ESM, FIPS and FIPS Updates.

    When attaching a machine to Ubuntu Pro, one can also specify services to
    enable. When the ``enable`` list is present, only named services will be
    activated. If the ``enable`` list is not present, the contract's default
    services will be enabled.

    On Pro instances, when ``ubuntu_pro`` config is provided to cloud-init,
    Pro's auto-attach feature will be disabled and cloud-init will perform
    the Pro auto-attach, ignoring the ``token`` key. The ``enable`` and
    ``enable_beta`` values will strictly determine what services will be
    enabled, ignoring contract defaults.

    Note that when enabling FIPS or FIPS updates you will need to schedule a
    reboot to ensure the machine is running the FIPS-compliant kernel. See the
    Power State Change module for information on how to configure cloud-init to
    perform this reboot.

      Example 1: Attach the machine to an Ubuntu Pro support contract with a
      Pro contract token obtained from https://ubuntu.com/pro.

      Example 2: Attach the machine to an Ubuntu Pro support contract, enabling
      only FIPS and ESM services. Services will only be enabled if the
      environment supports that service. Otherwise, warnings will be logged for
      incompatible services.

      Example 3: Attach the machine to an Ubuntu Pro support contract and
      enable the FIPS service. Perform a reboot once cloud-init has completed.

      Example 4: Set a HTTP(s) proxy before attaching the machine to an Ubuntu
      Pro support contract and enabling the FIPS service.
