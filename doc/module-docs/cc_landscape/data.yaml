  description: "This module installs and configures ``landscape-client``. The landscape\n\
    client will only be installed if the key ``landscape`` is present in\nconfig.\
    \ Landscape client configuration is given under the ``client`` key\nunder the\
    \ main ``landscape`` config key. The config parameters are not\ninterpreted by\
    \ cloud-init, but rather are converted into a ConfigObj\nformatted file and written\
    \ out to the `[client]` section in\n``/etc/landscape/client.conf``.\n\nThe following\
    \ default client config is provided, but can be overridden::\n\n    landscape:\n\
    \        client:\n            log_level: \"info\"\n            url: \"https://landscape.canonical.com/message-system\"\
    \n            ping_url: \"http://landscape.canoncial.com/ping\"\n            data_path:\
    \ \"/var/lib/landscape/client\"\n\n.. note::\n    see landscape documentation\
    \ for client config keys\n\n.. note::\n    if ``tags`` is defined, its contents\
    \ should be a string delimited with\n    ``,`` rather than a list\n"
