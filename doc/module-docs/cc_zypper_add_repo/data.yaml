    Zypper behavior can be configured using the ``config`` key, which will
    modify ``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf``. The configuration writer will only append
    the provided configuration options to the configuration file. Any duplicate
    options will be resolved by the way the ``zypp.conf`` INI file is parsed.
    
    .. note::
       Setting ``configdir`` is not supported and will be skipped.
       
    The ``repos`` key may be used to add repositories to the system. Beyond the
    required ``id`` and ``baseurl`` attributions, no validation is performed on
    the ``repos`` entries.

    It is assumed the user is familiar with the Zypper repository file format.
    This configuration is also applicable for systems with
    transactional-updates.
