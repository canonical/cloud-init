cc_resizefs:
  description: |
    Resize a filesystem to use all available space on partition. This module is
    useful along with ``cc_growpart`` and will ensure that if the root
    partition has been resized, the root filesystem will be resized along with
    it.

    By default, ``cc_resizefs`` will resize the root partition and will block
    the boot process while the ``resize`` command is running.

    Optionally, the resize operation can be performed in the background
    while cloud-init continues running modules. This can be enabled by setting
    ``resize_rootfs`` to ``noblock``.

    This module can be disabled altogether by setting ``resize_rootfs`` to
    ``false``.
