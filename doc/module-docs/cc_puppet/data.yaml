cc_puppet:
  description: 'This module handles puppet installation and configuration. If the

    ``puppet`` key does not exist in global configuration, no action will be

    taken. If a config entry for ``puppet`` is present, then by default the

    latest version of puppet will be installed. If the ``puppet`` config key

    exists in the config archive, this module will attempt to start puppet even

    if no installation was performed.


    The module also provides keys for configuring the new puppet 4 paths and

    installing the puppet package from the puppetlabs repositories:

    https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.2/reference/whered_it_go.html

    The keys are ``package_name``, ``conf_file``, ``ssl_dir`` and

    ``csr_attributes_path``. If unset, their values will default to

    ones that work with puppet 3.x and with distributions that ship modified

    puppet 4.x that uses the old paths.
