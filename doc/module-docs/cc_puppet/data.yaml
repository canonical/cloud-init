cc_puppet:
  description: |
    This module handles Puppet installation and configuration. If the
    ``puppet`` key does not exist in global configuration, no action will be
    taken.

    If a config entry for ``puppet`` is present, then by default the latest
    version of Puppet will be installed. If the ``puppet`` config key exists in
    the config archive, this module will attempt to start puppet even if no
    installation was performed.

    The module also provides keys for configuring the new Puppet 4 paths and
    installing the ``puppet`` package from the
    `puppetlabs repositories <https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.2/reference/whered_it_go.html>`_.

    The keys are ``package_name``, ``conf_file``, ``ssl_dir`` and
    ``csr_attributes_path``. If unset, their values will default to ones that
    work with Puppet 3.X, and with distributions that ship modified Puppet 4.X,
    that use the old paths.
