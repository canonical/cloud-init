cc_chef:
  description: |
    This module enables Chef to be installed (from packages, gems, or from
    omnibus). Before this occurs, Chef configuration is written to disk
    (``validation.pem``, ``client.pem``, ``firstboot.json``, ``client.rb``),
    and required directories are created (``/etc/chef`` and ``/var/log/chef``
    and so on).

    If configured, Chef will be installed and started in either daemon or
    non-daemon mode. If run in non-daemon mode, post-run actions are executed
    to do finishing activities such as removing ``validation.pem``.
