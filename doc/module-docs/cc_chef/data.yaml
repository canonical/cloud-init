cc_chef:
  description: 'This module enables chef to be installed (from packages,

    gems, or from omnibus). Before this occurs, chef configuration is

    written to disk (validation.pem, client.pem, firstboot.json,

    client.rb), and required directories are created (/etc/chef and

    /var/log/chef and so-on). If configured, chef will be

    installed and started in either daemon or non-daemon mode.

    If run in non-daemon mode, post run actions are executed to do

    finishing activities such as removing validation.pem.
