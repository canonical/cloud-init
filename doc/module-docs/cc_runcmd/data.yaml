cc_runcmd:
  description: |
    Run arbitrary commands at a ``rc.local``-like time-frame with output to the
    console. Each item can be either a list or a string. The item type affects
    how it is executed:

    - If the item is a string, it will be interpreted by ``sh``.
    - If the item is a list, the items will be executed as if passed to
      ``execve(3)`` (with the first argument as the command).

    The ``runcmd`` module only writes the script to be run later. The module
    that actually runs the script is ``scripts_user`` in the
    :ref:`Final boot stage <boot-Final>`.

    .. note::
       All commands must be proper YAML, so you must quote any characters YAML
       would eat (":" can be problematic).

    .. note::
       When writing files, do not use ``/tmp`` dir as it races with
       ``systemd-tmpfiles-clean`` (LP: #1707222). Use ``/run/somedir`` instead.
