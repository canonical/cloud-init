cc_runcmd:
  description: "Run arbitrary commands at a ``rc.local``-like time-frame with output\
    \ to\nthe console. Each item can be either a list or a string. The item type\n\
    affects how it is executed:\n\n- If the item is a string, it will be interpreted\
    \ by ``sh``.\n- If the item is a list, the items will be executed as if passed\
    \ to\n  ``execve(3)`` (with the first argument as the command).\n\nNote that the\
    \ ``runcmd`` module only writes the script to be run later.\nThe module that actually\
    \ runs the script is ``scripts_user`` in the\n:ref:`Final boot stage <boot-Final>`.\n\
    \n.. note::\n   All commands must be proper YAML, so you must quote any characters\
    \ YAML\n   would eat (':' can be problematic).\n\n.. note::\n   When writing files,\
    \ do not use ``/tmp`` dir as it races with\n   ``systemd-tmpfiles-clean`` (LP\
    \ \\#1707222). Use ``/run/somedir`` instead.\n"
