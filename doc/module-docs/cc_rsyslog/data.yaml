cc_rsyslog:
  description: |
    This module configures remote system logging using rsyslog.

    Configuration for remote servers can be specified in ``configs``, but for
    convenience it can be specified as key-value pairs in ``remotes``.

    This module can install rsyslog if not already present on the system using
    the ``install_rsyslog``, ``packages``, and ``check_exe`` options.
    Installation may not work on systems where this module runs before
    networking is up.

    .. note::
       On BSD, cloud-init will attempt to disable and stop the base system
       syslogd. This may fail on a first run. We recommend creating images
       with ``service syslogd disable``.
