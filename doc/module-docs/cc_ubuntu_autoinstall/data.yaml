cc_ubuntu_autoinstall:
  description: |
    The ``autoinstall`` key indicates a configuration for the Ubuntu installer.
    It is not acted on by cloud-init other than to ensure that the
    configuration is schema compliant and that the installer package is
    present on the system.

    .. note::
      The installer may use the provided configuration to instrument
      cloud-init on the target system. See
      `the Ubuntu installer documentation <https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/autoinstall-reference.html#user-data>`_
      for more information.
