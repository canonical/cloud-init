    Cloud-init is used by the Ubuntu installer in two stages.
    The ``autoinstall`` key may contain a configuration for the Ubuntu
    installer.

    Cloud-init verifies that an ``autoinstall`` key contains a ``version`` key
    and that the installer package is present on the system.

    .. note::
      The Ubuntu installer might pass part of this configuration to cloud-init
      during a later boot as part of the install process.
      See `the Ubuntu installer documentation <https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/autoinstall-reference.html#user-data>`_
      for more information. Please direct Ubuntu installer questions to
      their IRC channel (#ubuntu-server on Libera).
