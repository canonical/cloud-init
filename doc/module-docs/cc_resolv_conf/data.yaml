cc_resolv_conf:
  description: "Unless manually editing :file:`/etc/resolv.conf` is the correct way\
    \ to\nmanage nameserver information on your operating system, you do not want\
    \ to\nuse this module. Many distros have moved away from manually editing\n``resolv.conf``\
    \ so please verify that this is the preferred nameserver\nmanagement method for\
    \ your distro before using this module.\n\nNote that using :ref:`network_config`\
    \ is preferred, rather than using this\nmodule, when possible.\n\nThis module\
    \ is intended to manage resolv.conf in environments where early\nconfiguration\
    \ of resolv.conf is necessary for further bootstrapping and/or\nwhere configuration\
    \ management such as puppet or chef own DNS\nconfiguration.\n\nWhen using a :ref:`datasource_config_drive`\
    \ and a RHEL-like system,\nresolv.conf will also be managed automatically due\
    \ to the available\ninformation provided for DNS servers in the :ref:`network_config_v2`\n\
    format. For those that wish to have different settings, use this module.\n\nIn\
    \ order for the ``resolv_conf`` section to be applied,\n``manage_resolv_conf``\
    \ must be set ``true``.\n\n.. note::\n    For Red Hat with sysconfig, be sure\
    \ to set PEERDNS=no for all DHCP\n    enabled NICs.\n"
