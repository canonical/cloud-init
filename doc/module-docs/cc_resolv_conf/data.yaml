cc_resolv_conf:
  description: |
    You should not use this module unless manually editing
    :file:`/etc/resolv.conf` is the correct way to manage nameserver
    information on your operating system.
    
    Many distros have moved away from manually editing ``resolv.conf`` so
    please verify that this is the preferred nameserver management method for
    your distro before using this module. Note that using :ref:`network_config`
    is preferred, rather than using this module, when possible.

    This module is intended to manage ``resolv.conf`` in environments where
    early configuration of ``resolv.conf`` is necessary for further
    bootstrapping and/or where configuration management such as Puppet or Chef
    own DNS configuration.

    When using a :ref:`datasource_config_drive` and a RHEL-like system,
    ``resolv.conf`` will also be managed automatically due to the available
    information provided for DNS servers in the :ref:`network_config_v2`
    format. For those who wish to have different settings, use this module.

    For the ``resolv_conf`` section to be applied, ``manage_resolv_conf`` must
    be set ``true``.

    .. note::
       For Red Hat with ``sysconfig``, be sure to set ``PEERDNS=no`` for all
       DHCP-enabled NICs.
