  title: Run vendor scripts
  description: |
    On select Datasources, vendors have a channel for the consumption of all
    supported user data types via a special channel called vendor data. Any
    scripts in the ``scripts/vendor`` directory in the datasource will be run
    when a new instance is first booted. Scripts will be run in alphabetical
    order. This module allows control over the execution of vendor data.
  examples:
  - comment: ""
    file: cc_scripts_vendor/example1.yaml
  - comment: ""
    file: cc_scripts_vendor/example2.yaml
  - comment: Vendor data will not be processed
    file: cc_scripts_vendor/example3.yaml
