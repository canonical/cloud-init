  name: Apt Pipelining
  title: Configure apt pipelining
  description: |
     This module configures apt's ``Acquite::http::Pipeline-Depth`` option,
     which controls how apt handles HTTP pipelining. It may be useful for
     pipelining to be disabled, because some web servers, such as S3 do not
     pipeline properly (LP: #948461).

     Value configuration options for this module are:

     * ``os``: (Default) use distro default
     * ``false`` disable pipelining altogether
     * ``<number>``: Manually specify pipeline depth. This is not recommended.
