cc_grub_dpkg:
  description: 'Configure which device is used as the target for grub installation.
    This

    module can be enabled/disabled using the ``enabled`` config key in the

    ``grub_dpkg`` config dict. This module automatically selects a disk using

    ``grub-probe`` if no installation device is specified.


    The value which is placed into the debconf database is in the format which

    the grub postinstall script expects. Normally, this is a /dev/disk/by-id/

    value, but we do fallback to the plain disk name if a by-id name is not

    present.


    If this module is executed inside a container, then the debconf database is

    seeded with empty values, and install_devices_empty is set to true.
