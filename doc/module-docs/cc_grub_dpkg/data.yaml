cc_grub_dpkg:
  description: |
    Configure which device is used as the target for GRUB installation. This
    module can be enabled/disabled using the ``enabled`` config key in the
    ``grub_dpkg`` config dict. This module automatically selects a disk using
    ``grub-probe`` if no installation device is specified.

    The value placed into the debconf database is in the format expected by the
    GRUB post-install script expects. Normally, this is a ``/dev/disk/by-id/``
    value, but we do fallback to the plain disk name if a ``by-id`` name is not
    present.

    If this module is executed inside a container, then the debconf database is
    seeded with empty values, and ``install_devices_empty`` is set to ``true``.
