  description: "This module provides a simple configuration namespace in cloud-init\
    \ for\nsetting up snapd and installing snaps.\n\n.. note::\n   Both ``assertions``\
    \ and ``commands`` values can be either a dictionary\n   or a list. If these configs\
    \ are provided as a dictionary, the keys are\n   only used to order the execution\
    \ of the assertions or commands and the\n   dictionary is merged with any vendor\
    \ data snap configuration provided.\n   If a list is provided by the user instead\
    \ of a dict, any vendor data\n   snap configuration is ignored.\n   \nThe ``assertions``\
    \ configuration option is a dictionary or list of\nproperly-signed snap assertions\
    \ which will run before any snap commands.\nThey will be added to snapd's ``assertion``\
    \ database by invoking\n``snap ack <aggregate_assertion_file>``.\n\nSnap ``commands``\
    \ is a dictionary or list of individual snap commands to\nrun on the target system.\
    \ These commands can be used to create snap users,\ninstall snaps and provide\
    \ snap configuration.\n\n.. note::\n   If 'side-loading' private/unpublished snaps\
    \ on an instance, it is best\n   to create a snap seed directory and ``seed.yaml``\
    \ manifest in\n   ``/var/lib/snapd/seed/`` which snapd automatically installs\
    \ on startup.\n"

  - comment: 'For convenience, the snap command can be omitted when specifying commands

      as a list and ''snap'' will automatically be prepended.

      The following commands are all equivalent:
