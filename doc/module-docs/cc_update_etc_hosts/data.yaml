cc_update_etc_hosts:
  description: |
    This module will update the contents of the local hosts database (hosts
    file, usually ``/etc/hosts``) based on the hostname/FQDN specified in
    config. Management of the hosts file is controlled using
    ``manage_etc_hosts``. If this is set to ``false``, cloud-init will not
    manage the hosts file at all. This is the default behavior.

    If set to ``true``, cloud-init will generate the hosts file using the
    template located in ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``. In the
    ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl`` template, the strings ``$hostname``
    and ``$fqdn`` will be replaced with the hostname and FQDN respectively.
    
    If ``manage_etc_hosts`` is set to ``localhost``, then cloud-init will not
    rewrite the hosts file entirely, but rather will ensure that an entry for
    the FQDN with a distribution-dependent IP is present (i.e.,
    ``ping <hostname>`` will ping ``127.0.0.1`` or ``127.0.1.1`` or other IP).
    
    .. note::
       If ``manage_etc_hosts`` is set to ``true``, the contents of the
       ``hosts`` file will be updated every boot. To make any changes to the
       ``hosts`` file persistent they must be made in
       ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.
       
    .. note::
       For instructions on specifying hostname and FQDN, see documentation for
       the ``cc_set_hostname`` module.
  examples:
  - comment: >
      Example 1: Do not update or manage ``/etc/hosts`` at all. This is the
      default behavior. Whatever is present at instance boot time will be
      present after boot. User changes will not be overwritten.

      Example 2: Manage ``/etc/hosts`` with cloud-init. On every boot,
      ``/etc/hosts`` will be re-written from
      ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.

      The strings ``$hostname`` and ``$fqdn`` are replaced in the template
      with the appropriate values, either from the config-config ``fqdn`` or
      ``hostname`` if provided. When absent, the cloud metadata will be
      checked for ``local-hostname`` which can be split into
      ``<hostname>.<fqdn>``.

      To make modifications persistent across a reboot, you must modify
      ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.

      Example 3: Update ``/etc/hosts`` every boot, providing a "localhost"
      ``127.0.1.1`` entry with the latest hostname and FQDN as provided by
      either IMDS or cloud-config. All other entries will be left alone.
      ``ping hostname`` will ping ``127.0.1.1``.
