cc_update_etc_hosts:
  description: "This module will update the contents of the local hosts database (hosts\n\
    file, usually ``/etc/hosts``) based on the hostname/FQDN specified in\nconfig.\
    \ Management of the hosts file is controlled using\n``manage_etc_hosts``. If this\
    \ is set to ``false``, cloud-init will not\nmanage the hosts file at all. This\
    \ is the default behavior.\n\nIf set to ``true``, cloud-init will generate the\
    \ hosts file using the\ntemplate located in ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.\
    \ In the\n``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl`` template, the strings ``$hostname``\n\
    and ``$fqdn`` will be replaced with the hostname and FQDN respectively.\n\nIf\
    \ ``manage_etc_hosts`` is set to ``localhost``, then cloud-init will not\nrewrite\
    \ the hosts file entirely, but rather will ensure that an entry for\nthe FQDN\
    \ with a distribution-dependent IP is present (i.e.,\n``ping <hostname>`` will\
    \ ping ``127.0.0.1`` or ``127.0.1.1`` or other IP).\n\n.. note::\n   If ``manage_etc_hosts``\
    \ is set to ``true``, the contents of the\n   ``hosts`` file will be updated every\
    \ boot. To make any changes to the\n   ``hosts`` file persistent they must be\
    \ made in\n   ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.\n\n.. note::\n   For instructions\
    \ on specifying hostname and FQDN, see documentation for\n   the ``cc_set_hostname``\
    \ module.\n"
  examples:
  - comment: 'Do not update or manage ``/etc/hosts`` at all. This is the default

      behavior. Whatever is present at instance boot time will be present

      after boot. User changes will not be overwritten.

    file: cc_update_etc_hosts/example1.yaml
  - comment: 'Manage ``/etc/hosts`` with cloud-init. On every boot, ``/etc/hosts``

      will be re-written from ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.


      The strings ``$hostname`` and ``$fqdn`` are replaced in the template

      with the appropriate values, either from the config-config ``fqdn`` or

      ``hostname`` if provided. When absent, the cloud metadata will be

      checked for ``local-hostname`` which can be split into

      ``<hostname>.<fqdn>``.


      To make modifications persistent across a reboot, you must modify

      ``/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl``.

    file: cc_update_etc_hosts/example2.yaml
  - comment: 'Update ``/etc/hosts`` every boot, providing a "localhost" ``127.0.1.1``

      entry with the latest hostname and FQDN as provided by either IMDS or

      cloud-config. All other entries will be left alone. ``ping hostname``

      will ping ``127.0.1.1``.
