cc_growpart:
  description: "Growpart resizes partitions to fill the available disk space.\nThis\
    \ is useful for cloud instances with a larger amount of disk space available\n\
    than the pristine image uses, as it allows the instance to automatically make\n\
    use of the extra space. Note that this only works if the partition to be\nresized\
    \ is the last one on a disk with classic partitioning scheme (MBR, BSD,\nGPT).\
    \ LVM, Btrfs and ZFS have no such restrictions.\n\nThe devices on which to run\
    \ growpart are specified as a list under the\n``devices`` key.\n\nThere is some\
    \ functionality overlap between this module and the ``growroot``\nfunctionality\
    \ of ``cloud-initramfs-tools``. However, there are some situations\nwhere one\
    \ tool is able to function and the other is not. The default\nconfiguration for\
    \ both should work for most cloud instances. To explicitly\nprevent ``cloud-initramfs-tools``\
    \ from running ``growroot``, the file\n``/etc/growroot-disabled`` can be created.\
    \ By default, both ``growroot`` and\n``cc_growpart`` will check for the existence\
    \ of this file and will not run if\nit is present. However, this file can be ignored\
    \ for ``cc_growpart`` by setting\n``ignore_growroot_disabled`` to ``true``. For\
    \ more information on\n``cloud-initramfs-tools`` see: https://launchpad.net/cloud-initramfs-tools\n\
    \nOn FreeBSD, there is also the ``growfs`` service, which has a lot of overlap\n\
    with ``cc_growpart`` and ``cc_resizefs``, but only works on the root partition.\n\
    In that configuration, we use it, otherwise, we fall back to ``gpart``.\n\nNote\
    \ however, that ``growfs`` may insert a swap partition, if none is present,\n\
    unless instructed not to via ``growfs_swap_size=0`` in either ``kenv(1)``, or\n\
    ``rc.conf(5)``.\n\nGrowpart is enabled by default on the root partition. The default\
    \ config for\ngrowpart is::\n\n    growpart:\n      mode: auto\n      devices:\
    \ [\"/\"]\n      ignore_growroot_disabled: false\n"
