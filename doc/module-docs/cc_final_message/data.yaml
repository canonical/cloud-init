cc_final_message:
  description: |
    This module configures the final message that cloud-init writes. The
    message is specified as a Jinja template with the following variables set:

    - ``version``: cloud-init version
    - ``timestamp``: time at cloud-init finish
    - ``datasource``: cloud-init data source
    - ``uptime``: system uptime

    This message is written to the cloud-init log (usually
    ``/var/log/cloud-init.log``) as well as stderr (which usually redirects to
    ``/var/log/cloud-init-output.log``).

    Upon exit, this module writes the system uptime, timestamp, and cloud-init
    version to ``/var/lib/cloud/instance/boot-finished`` independent of any
    user data specified for this module.
