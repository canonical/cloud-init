  description: "This module handles shutdown/reboot after all config modules have\
    \ been run. By\ndefault it will take no action, and the system will keep running\
    \ unless a\npackage installation/upgrade requires a system reboot (e.g. installing\
    \ a new\nkernel) and ``package_reboot_if_required`` is true.\n\nUsing this module\
    \ ensures that cloud-init is entirely finished with\nmodules that would be executed.\n\
    \nAn example to distinguish delay from timeout:\n\nIf you delay 5 (5 minutes)\
    \ and have a timeout of\n120 (2 minutes), then the max time until shutdown will\
    \ be 7 minutes, though\nit could be as soon as 5 minutes. Cloud-init will invoke\
    \ 'shutdown +5' after\nthe process finishes, or when 'timeout' seconds have elapsed.\n\
    \n.. note::\n    With Alpine Linux any message value specified is ignored as Alpine's\
    \ halt,\n    poweroff, and reboot commands do not support broadcasting a message.\n"
