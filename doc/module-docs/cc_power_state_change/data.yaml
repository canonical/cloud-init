cc_power_state_change:
  description: |
    This module handles shutdown/reboot after all config modules have been
    run. By default it will take no action, and the system will keep running
    unless a package installation/upgrade requires a system reboot (e.g.
    installing a new kernel) and ``package_reboot_if_required`` is ``true``.

    Using this module ensures that cloud-init is entirely finished with modules
    that would be executed. An example to distinguish delay from timeout:

    If you delay 5 (5 minutes) and have a timeout of 120 (2 minutes), the max
    time until shutdown will be 7 minutes, though it could be as soon as 5
    minutes. Cloud-init will invoke 'shutdown +5' after the process finishes,
    or when 'timeout' seconds have elapsed.

    .. note::
       With Alpine Linux any message value specified is ignored as Alpine's
       ``halt``, ``poweroff``, and ``reboot`` commands do not support
       broadcasting a message.
