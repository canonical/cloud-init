cc_package_update_upgrade_install:
  description: |
    This module allows packages to be updated, upgraded or installed during
    boot. If any packages are to be installed or an upgrade is to be performed
    then the package cache will be updated first. If a package installation or
    upgrade requires a reboot, then a reboot can be performed if
    ``package_reboot_if_required`` is specified.
