cc_package_update_upgrade_install:
  description: |
    This module allows packages to be updated, upgraded or installed during
    boot using any available package manager present on a system such as apt,
    pkg, snap, yum or zypper. If any packages are to be installed or an upgrade
    is to be performed then the package cache will be updated first. If a
    package installation or upgrade requires a reboot, then a reboot can be
    performed if ``package_reboot_if_required`` is specified.
