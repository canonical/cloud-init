cc_bootcmd:
  description: |
    This module runs arbitrary commands very early in the boot process, only
    slightly after a boothook would run. This is very similar to a boothook,
    but more user friendly. Commands can be
    specified either as lists or strings. For invocation details, see
    ``runcmd``.

    .. note::
       ``bootcmd`` should only be used for things that could not be done later
       in the boot process.

    .. note::
       When writing files, do not use ``/tmp`` dir as it races with
       ``systemd-tmpfiles-clean`` (LP: #1707222). Use ``/run/somedir`` instead.
    .. warning::
         Use of ``INSTANCE_ID`` variable within this module is deprecated.
         Use :ref:`jinja templates<user_data_formats-jinja>` with
         :ref:`v1.instance_id<v1_instance_id>` instead.
