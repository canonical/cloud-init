cc_bootcmd:
  description: "This module runs arbitrary commands very early in the boot process,\n\
    only slightly after a boothook would run. This is very similar to a\nboothook,\
    \ but more user friendly. The environment variable\n``INSTANCE_ID`` will be set\
    \ to the current instance id for all run\ncommands. Commands can be specified\
    \ either as lists or strings. For\ninvocation details, see ``runcmd``.\n\n.. note::\n\
    \n    bootcmd should only be used for things that could not be done later\n  \
    \  in the boot process.\n\n.. note::\n\n   when writing files, do not use /tmp\
    \ dir as it races with\n   systemd-tmpfiles-clean LP: #1707222. Use /run/somedir\
    \ instead.\n"
