  title: Install hotplug udev rules if supported and enabled
  description: |
    This module will install the udev rules to enable hotplug if
    supported by the datasource and enabled in the userdata. The udev
    rules will be installed as
    ``/etc/udev/rules.d/90-cloud-init-hook-hotplug.rules``.

    When hotplug is enabled, newly added network devices will be added
    to the system by cloud-init. After udev detects the event,
    cloud-init will refresh the instance metadata from the datasource,
    detect the device in the updated metadata, then apply the updated
    network configuration.

    Currently supported datasources: Openstack, EC2
