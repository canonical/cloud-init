cc_install_hotplug:
  description: |
    This module will install the udev rules to enable hotplug if supported by
    the datasource and enabled in the userdata. The udev rules will be
    installed as ``/etc/udev/rules.d/90-cloud-init-hook-hotplug.rules``.

    When hotplug is enabled, newly added network devices will be added to the
    system by cloud-init. After udev detects the event, cloud-init will
    refresh the instance metadata from the datasource, detect the device in
    the updated metadata, then apply the updated network configuration.

    Currently supported datasources: Openstack, EC2
