# TODO

The following lists complete or partially misisng modules. If a module is
listed with nothing below it indicates that no work is completed on that
module. If there is a list below the module name that is the remainig
identified work.

## apt_configure

  * apt_get_wrapper
    * What does this do? How to use it?
  * apt_get_command
    * To specify a different 'apt-get' command, set 'apt_get_command'.
    This must be a list, and the subcommand (update, upgrade) is appended to it.
    * Modify default and verify the options got passed correctly.
  * preserve sources
    * TBD
