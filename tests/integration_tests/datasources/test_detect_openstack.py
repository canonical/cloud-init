    """This test is twofold: it tests kernel commandline override, which also
    validates OpenStack Ironic requirements. OpenStack Ironic does not
    advertise itself to cloud-init via any of the conventional methods: DMI,
    etc.

    On systemd, ds-identify is able to grok kernel commandline, however to
    support cloud-init kernel command line parsing on non-systemd, parsing
    kernel commandline in Python code is required.

    This test runs on LXD, but forces cloud-init to attempt to run OpenStack.
    This will inevitably fail on LXD, but we only care that it tried - on
    Ironic it will succeed.

    Configure grub's kernel command line to tell cloud-init to use OpenStack
    - even though LXD should naturally be detected.
