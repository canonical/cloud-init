"""Integration test for LP: #1898997

cloud-init was incorrectly excluding Open vSwitch bridge members from its list
of interfaces.  This meant that instances which had only one interface which
was in an Open vSwitch bridge would not boot correctly: cloud-init would not
find the expected physical interfaces, so would not apply network config.

This test checks that cloud-init believes it has successfully applied the
network configuration, and confirms that the bridge can be used to ping the
default gateway.
