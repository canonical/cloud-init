- Consider a 'failsafe' DataSource
  If all others fail, setting a default that
   - sets the user password, writing it to console
   - logs to console that this happened
- Consider a 'previous' DataSource
  If no other data source is found, fall back to the 'previous' one
  keep a indication of what instance id that is in /var/lib/cloud
- Rewrite "cloud-init-query" (currently not implemented)
  Possibly have DataSource and cloudinit expose explicit fields
   - instance-id
   - hostname
   - mirror
   - release
   - ssh public keys
- Remove the conversion of the ubuntu network interface format conversion
  to a RH/fedora format and replace it with a top level format that uses
  the netcf libraries format instead (which itself knows how to translate
  into the specific formats)
- Replace the 'apt*' modules with variants that now use the distro classes
  to perform distro independent packaging commands (where possible)
- Canonicalize the semaphore/lock name for modules and user data handlers
  a. It is most likely a bug that currently exists that if a module in config
     alters its name and it has already ran, then it will get ran again since
     the lock name hasn't be canonicalized
- Replace some the LOG.debug calls with a LOG.info where appropriate instead
  of how right now there is really only 2 levels (WARN and DEBUG)
- Remove the 'cc_' for config modules, either have them fully specified (ie
  'cloudinit.config.resizefs') or by default only look in the 'cloudinit.config'
  for these modules (or have a combination of the above), this avoids having
  to understand where your modules are coming from (which can be altered by
  the current python inclusion path)
