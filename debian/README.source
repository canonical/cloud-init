=== General Info ===
Development packaging branch is at
   lp:ubuntu/<suite>/cloud-init
alternatively, if you're on the development release:
   lp:ubuntu/cloud-init

Patches in debian/patches are also stored applied in bzr.

To cherry pick revisions 391 to tip from from trunk, do something like:
  s=391; e=;
  b=../trunk;
  [ -n "${e}" ] || e=$(cd ${b} && bzr revno)
  pfile=catchup-${s}${e:+-${e}}.patch
  [ "$s" = "$e" ] && pfile=catchup-${s}.patch
  ( cd ../trunk && bzr log -r$s..$e &&
      bzr diff -p1 -r$(($s-1))..$e ) > ../$pfile.full
  mkdir -p debian/patches
  filterdiff --exclude "*/ChangeLog" < ../$pfile.full > debian/patches/$pfile
  echo "$pfile" >> debian/patches/series
  quilt push
  quilt refresh
  files="$(quilt files ${pfile}) debian/patches/series debian/patches/${pfile}"
  files="$files .pc/${pfile} .pc/applied-patches"
  bzr add $files

  # now add an entry
  dch --append "${pfile} (sync to $e)"
  dch --edit # improve the entry
  debcommit $files

  ../$pfile.full will have the full diff.  See 'ChangeLog' entries there
  and debian/patches/$pfile for help writing debian/changelog entry

You can set 'e' (end) to not go to tip.

== Cherry pick single patch ==
There is a utility in debian/cherry-pick-rev that will
help to cherry pick a single commit from trunk.

== New snapshot ==
To pull a new upstream snapshot, given lp:cloud-init in ../trunk:

 ./debian/new-upstream-snapshot ../trunk
