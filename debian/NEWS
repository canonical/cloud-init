cloud-init (24.4~4gc9dce94d-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  Cloud-init added cloud-specific metapackages to better express
  cloud-specific dependencies and reduce image size.

  The original cloud-init is still available as a metapackage and a smaller
  version (called cloud-init-base) has been created to include just the
  essential dependencies.

  A few specific metapackages have been created, while more cloud-specific
  ones are under development. The current set include:

  * cloud-init-base - package that contains the cloud-init code along with
    the minimal set of dependencies
  * cloud-init - is a metapackage that retains every previous dependency
  * cloud-init-cloud-sigma and cloud-init-smart-os - metapackages with an
    additional dependency on python3-serial. They can be installed if the
    target platform is CloudSigma or SmartOS

  If you are an image builder:

  * Install ``cloud-init``, containing all dependencies, if the target
    platform is unknown
  * Install ``cloud-init-base`` if the target platform(s) are known and do
    not require specific dependencies
  * Install a cloud-specific metapackage if the target platform has some
    specific dependency requirements.
